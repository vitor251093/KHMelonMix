3. Dump an original copy of "Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days" and copy the NDS file to your computer;
4. Rename that NDS file to "days.nds", place it inside a folder named "roms", and then place that folder next to the Melon Mix executable that you just copied;
5. Replace the assets folder with [this assets folder](https://mega.nz/folder/lpgykK5Y#HPJuOSceHSzncDjQh0DUtw) (this step is only required if you want to replace the DS cutscenes with HD cutscenes);
