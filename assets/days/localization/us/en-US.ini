0x0689D35C=Ugh, I'm already frying out here.
0x0689D3B4=C'mon, kiddo. Let's get this\ninvestigation over and done with.
0x0689D404=As if.
0x0689D40C=Do you think it's true―about the\nmembers stationed at Castle Oblivion?
0x0689D458=Let's go, kiddo.
0x0689D46C=Look, the faster we get this mission\ndone, the sooner you can RTC and get\nyour answers.
0x0689D4C4=Maybe multiple comrades.\nThat doesn't bother you at all?
0x0689D604=Fine.
0x0689D60C=We might have lost a comrade.
0x0689D62C=What's wrong?\nDazzled by the new scenery?
0x0689D658=Ha ha, is that seriously what's eating\nyou?
0x0689F038=Huh?
0x0689F064=Still with me there?\nI've seen you spaced out before, but\nthis is ridiculous.
0x0689F16C=Let me guess.\nCastle Oblivion?
0x0689F18C=Like I said: the longer we take here,\nthe longer you're gonna have to stay\nin the dark.
0x0689F1E4=Past that, not much to mention, though.\nSeems like a pretty normal town, yeah?
0x0689F260=What? I'm fine.\nI'm fine...
0x0689F2F4=I know.
0x0689F310=This place is swimming in sand.
0x0689F348=I guess them's the breaks when you\nbuild your city in the middle of the\ndesert.
0x068A1C94=Why, Roxas?\nDid you leave the toaster plugged in?
0x068A1CE0=If only Genie were around...
0x068A1E14=Heh heh.\nC'mon, let's RTC.
0x068A1E30=True.
0x068A1E38=But he definitely wasn't royalty...\nThe girl next to him―now SHE was\nroyalty.
0x068A1ED8=So what now?\nDo we look around inside the palace?
0x068A1F0C=You should get some rest, Aladdin.
0x068A1F80=It's the kind of thing you'd expect\nsomebody in the palace to be doing.\nThey already call the shots, right?
0x068A202C=No need. We have our answers, and we\neven got a peek at their leaders.
0x068A217C=That's true, but still...
0x068A2288=Wait. I'll help, too.
0x068A22AC=...we need to get everything running\nagain before it does.
0x068A22E8=Jasmine, you don't need to worry―\nI'm fine. And since we don't know when\nthe next storm will hit...
0x068A23D0=Good, then we can go home?
0x068A23EC=So that guy must be spearheading the\ncity repair efforts.
0x068A243C=Does he have to be?
0x068A2450=I'll be okay. Besides, the sandstorm's\nfinally let up―now's our chance to\npatch up the city.
0x068A24D0=Now, I should get back to work.
0x068A24F0=The question is, why him?\nHe doesn't look like royalty.
0x068A2548=You know why.
0x068A257C=Agrabah's our city.\nWe need to be the ones to fix it up.
0x068A264C=Of course, you're right...
0x068A2668=You'll run yourself ragged at this rate.
0x068A26AC=I miss him, too, but this isn't a job for\nmagic.
0x068A26E4=It's not easy getting people to follow\nyou, especially when it involves work.
0x068A3D24=Normally, I'd be able to just slip on by,\nbut the way you stick out? Well.
0x068A3E38=Oh oh.
0x068A3E40=Those must be the locals.
0x068A3E8C=(Thanks.)
0x068A3EB4=We'd better take the long way around.
0x068A3F04=Uh-oh.
0x068A4B90=It'll cause a big scene if we're spotted.\nLet's find another way around.
0x068A7610=Heartless!?
0x068A761C=Unfortunately, yes. All the merchants\nwere talking about it.
0x068A76D4=Oh no... I hope this isn't a sign of\nthings to come.
0x068A770C=The Heartless―they've been showing\nup all over Agrabah.
0x068A78B4=And that's only one of the things that's\ngot me worried.
0x068A78F0=Another sandstorm?\nAre you sure, Aladdin?
0x068A791C=Yeah. They always appear right before\na sandstorm hits.
0x068A7990=Why? What else is wrong?
0x068A79C4=I thought it was just a coincidence\nduring the last storm, but...
0x068A7A60=This is terrible...
0x068A9104=Hey!\nGet back here, Abu!
0x068A913C=Uhp! No excuses! We made a promise:\nno more stealing! Now c'mon, let's go\ngive this back.
0x068A91F4=I told you, you can't just take things\nfrom the marketplace!
0x068AAD18=Yeah...
0x068AAD60=Whaddaya say we make this quick?
0x068AD418=Just make sure he doesn't lay eyes on\nyou, follow?
0x068AD44C=Change of plans, Roxas!\nOur new mission is following Lunkhead\nthere.
0x068AD494=I guess...
0x068AD4A0=No, I'd call it flexible thinking.\nGot it memorized?
0x068AD4E0=Where is it? It's gotta be around here\nsomewheres...
0x068AD56C=Now the key here is to keep your eyes\non him, Roxas.
0x068AD5A4=Now who is that?\nAnd what's he up to?
0x068AD6E4=But...we're out on heart collection.\nWon't we get in trouble if we just―
0x068AD7D0=And once I find the lamp that's stashed\ndown there...
0x068AD808=Good, then we're agreed.
0x068AD830=Heh heh heh...\nAll my wishes'll come true.
0x068AD874=But wouldn't you still call it disobeying\norders?
0x068AD8A8=Grrr... Well, I ain't givin' up till I find\na way in!
0x068AD8E0=Looking into any suspicious characters\nyou come across is an important part\nof the job.
0x068ADA6C=He thinks some lamp is gonna grant his\nwishes?
0x068ADAD8=He wasn't here the last time I came by,\nthat's for sure.
0x068ADB40=Plus, we'll still have plenty of time to\ncollect hearts afterwards. No harm,\nno foul.
0x068ADB98=What?
0x068ADBBC=Hmm...
0x068ADBC4=Yeah, strange guy.
0x068AFBE0=What's he staring at that wall for,\nanyway?
0x068AFC38=A hidden door in the middle of the city?\nWhy? Where does it lead?
0x068AFC7C=Keep tailing him.\nAnd try to be subtle about it.
0x068AFCC8=Bingo!
0x068AFD0C=Open sesames!
0x068AFD68=I think our friend there is about to\nshow us.
0x068AFDA4=Roxas, we wouldn't be investigating if\nwe knew all the answers.
0x068AFE8C=Heh heh heh!\nI finally found it!
0x068B1320=I'll say.\nThis is a nice little bonus.
0x068B1384=Never would've guessed this was here.
0x068B2B74=Like I said, flexible thinking.
0x068B2B94=What happened to this being an\nimportant part of the job?
0x068B2BF8=Plus, searching a place this big would\nbe a royal pain.
0x068B2C30=So, what now?
0x068B2C54=Ha ha. Oh, I see...
0x068B2C68=Hey, let's just get this mission over\nand done with.
0x068B2CA0=Just finding out about this cave is\nenough of a feather in our cap for\ntoday.
0x068B2D90=This cave's bigger than it looks from\nthe outside... Hey, I think we lost him.
0x068B2E50=Guess we'll have to give up for now.\nSwitch back to heart collection.
0x068B2EEC=You don't want to look for him?
0x068B2F4C=Nah. I would've liked to know what he\nwas up to, but hey.
0x068B6108=Right. Axel and I found it the last time\nwe were here. There's a hidden\nentrance in the city.
0x068B6168=By accident, mostly.
0x068B61C0=So our orders are to investigate a\ncave this time?
0x068B61F4=Yeah. The hidden door's down that way.\nC'mon.
0x068B6228=Wow, how'd you stumble across that?
0x068B626C=So, you ready to go explore it?
0x068B6298=And that led you to the cave...\nGood call on Axel's part.
0x068B6410=We spotted somebody acting fishy, and\nAxel suggested we tail him.
0x068B796C=Roger that!
0x068B7978=Uh-oh. We're not alone.
0x068B7A1C=Heartless...
0x068B7A2C=Let's clear them out!
0x068B7A88=Like we have any choice.
0x068B7B40=What do you wanna do?
0x068B9A40=(That monkey...\n I saw him here last time, too.)
0x068B9A90=Hmm, then I guess I'll hold onto it.\nIt might come in handy.
0x068B9AFC=What do you think?\nShould we just leave it?
0x068B9B48=It's up to you, Xion.
0x068B9BCC=Okay.\nLet's head for the cave.
0x068B9C20=(Where'd he swipe something like this?)
0x068B9CFC=We may not get a chance to return it,\nbut if you don't pick it up, somebody\nelse will.
0x068B9DA0=He must've dropped it.
0x068B9DDC=Hey, Roxas, look...
0x068BB1F8=Hunh, it looks about the same size as\nthe gem I found.
0x068BB238=There's a hole here...\nIt's like something's meant to fit inside.
0x068BB364=Hey...\nWhat do you make of this?
0x068BD508=No way!\nIt clicked right into place!
0x068BD538=Guess that explains where the monkey\nfound it.
0x068BD5D0=If it was here to begin with, it should\nprobably stay here.
0x068BD6C8=Ready to dig a little deeper?
0x068BEFF4=Hmph!\nHere for the magic lamp, are ya?
0x068BF034=So you goons can keep your dirty mitts\noff!
0x068BF0D0=You listen up an' listen good!\nThat lamp is official property of Pete―\nthat's me! Ya got it?
0x068BF130=Hey, who are you bozos!?
0x068BF1EC=Don't try and play dumb with me!
0x068BF234=Uh-oh... I know you...
0x068BF2CC=What magic lamp?
0x068C1AB0=Rrrrrrgh... Ya puny little punks!
0x068C1B70=Come on, Roxas!\nWe can't stay here!
0x068C1BC4=I'm outta here!
0x068C1BD4=Yeah, you're right.\nHurry!
0x068C1BF0=Zoinks! This can't be good!
0x068C1C70=First I can't find the dag-blasted lamp,\nnow I gotta deal with these weirdos...
0x068C1D08=It just ain't fair!
0x068C1DC8=H-hey, wait!
0x068C8788=What!?
0x068C8820=So, uh, who are you kids?
0x068C883C=Uh, y-yeah...\nLikewise.
0x068C88C0=What...what am I looking at?
0x068C88E0=Anyway, uhh... Agrabah is that city\nover there, right?
0x068C8AEC=Inseparable?
0x068C8B8C=We're, umm―\n(Change it to WHAT?)
0x068C8BB0=Well, I don't know about anybody named\nAl, but...
0x068C8CB0=But we got to worrying about how Al\nwas doing...
0x068C8CE4=I think it likes you.
0x068C8D98=Wh-who are you!?
0x068C8E04=Oh... Well, if that's Al's final word, I\nguess that's that.
0x068C8E40=There we go.\nNow the city's safe!
0x068C8EC0=Why do these things always happen the\nminute I leave town!?
0x068C8EFC=Y-yes?
0x068C8F10=Right, they keep getting hit by\nsandstorms.
0x068C8F84=We should get back, Roxas.
0x068C8FA0=Who am I?\nYou want to know who I am!?
0x068C8FC8=...so we figured we'd pop back in to\ncheck up on him.
0x068C9000=A friend?\nAnd that friend is me?
0x068C907C=You're not going to help out?
0x068C909C=Your friend Al said this isn't a job for\nmagic.
0x068C913C=I'd love to just fix the place, but even\na genie's got to respect his friend's\nwishes.
0x068C91A0=Ah! Roxas, behind you!
0x068C9258=Yaaagh!
0x068C9278=And this is my good friend, the Magic\nCarpet!
0x068C92C8=The city's in rough shape.\nThey've been fixing it up.
0x068C9300=You sure this is a friend of ours,\nRugman?
0x068C9334=Huh?
0x068C93C4=Hmm... I guess so.
0x068C9444=Psst! Roxas, change the subject!
0x068C9474=All right, stand back!\nA little magic, and I'll have this place\nwhipped back into shape!
0x068C9520=No doubt.
0x068C9544=When, all of a sudden, Carpet here\ndecides to put the tassel to the metal\nand take off! Says he spotted a friend.
0x068C95B8=But I have no idea in the cosmos who\nyou are!
0x068C95E8=Figure that one out.
0x068C9668=Yeah...
0x068C9670=I mean, why so glum? Feeling a little\nblue? Believe me, I can relate.
0x068C96B8=Okay, forget “who.”\nWHERE are you two!?
0x068C974C=Me, I was just swinging by Agrabah to\ncheck in...
0x068C9780=So, I take it that was the guy?
0x068C97A0=The one me and Axel saw? Yeah.\nPete, I think he said?
0x068C9800=And with THAT out of the way...\nEnough stalling―who are you two?
0x068C988C=Why were you worried?\nIs there something to worry about?
0x068C98C8=Yeah, figure that one out!
0x068C993C=Yep! Until Carpet and I took off on a\nwell deserved vacation. What you might\ncall a mini world tour.
0x068C99A4=Aaack!
0x068C99AC=Errr, we're...
0x068C99BC=He said the people living there should\nbe the ones to fix it up.
0x068C9A00=I worried about how things were going\nwith Jasmine, how the city was holding\nup...
0x068C9A68=OK...
0x068C9A94=Still, I doubt he'd mind a teensy-weensy\nspeck of help!
0x068C9ACC=That's the one! My buddy Al's hometown.\nWhy, when we first met, Al and I were\ninseparable...
0x068C9B2C=You okay?
0x068C9B38=Whew... We made it.
0x068C9B58=And once I get something on my mind,\nI can't knock it out―tried everything:\ndynamite, sledgehammers, tweezers...
0x068C9C10=The name's Genie Formerly-Of-The-\nLamp...but call me by my first name,\nkids!
0x068C9C60=Well all right, then! One personal\nintroduction, coming right up!
0x068C9CA4=Yeah...\nIt doesn't seem hostile.
0x068C9D2C=I know, crazy isn't it?\nI tag along all ready to reminisce about\nold times...
0x068C9DBC=Nice to meetcha!
0x068C9DD0=Well, sure! It's only natural to worry\nabout your friends.
0x068C9E0C=He what!?
0x068C9EBC=Just barely.
0x068C9ECC=Yeah. He kept going on about some\nmagic lamp.
0x068C9F2C=Al said no magic, right?
0x068C9F88=Hey, come ON now, you can do better\nthan that!
0x068C9FB8=Wonder what he meant.
0x068CBE88=Hold on... We still need to watch out\nfor the Heartless.
0x068CBEC4=It's just like I said―the sandstorm\nmoving across the desert up and\nvanished.
0x068CBF14=Now we can finally go outside the city\nagain.
0x068CBF44=They've been sighted around Agrabah\neven after the storm cleared up.\nYou'll have to be careful, Jasmine.
0x068CC014=What do you mean, “it disappeared”?
0x068CC10C=All right.\nI want you to be safe too, Aladdin.
0x068CC164=I'm gonna go make sure everything's\nokay.
0x068CC214=Well, that's wonderful!\nWhat a relief.
0x068D1704=Eerily quiet. There are definitely fewer\nHeartless out there than before.
0x068D1750=It's not my fault you pop out of\nnowhere!
0x068D1840=It's a long story, amigo?\nLong, long ago, before time was time...
0x068D18D8=Oh, stop. I'm not that scary.
0x068D18F8=This, from the guy who vanished into\nthin air the last time we met!
0x068D194C=Agh!
0x068D1968=I'm glad to see Al's doing all right.\nNow I can enjoy the rest of my\nvacation free of worries!
0x068D1A00=Nobody ever told you that three's a\ncrowd? Well, it's time for the crowd to\nclear out!
0x068D1A58=Okay, then.\nThis time, it's so long for real!
0x068D1B38=Aww...
0x068D1BC4=How did things look?
0x068D1BDC=Well, anyway...
0x068D1BEC=Yaaagh!
0x068D1BF4=You really want to know?
0x068D1C28=Never mind, then.
0x068D1C3C=Or at least focus on getting things\nrebuilt.
0x068D1C94=What's that guy's story, anyway?\nHe said he used to be a genie in a\nlamp...
0x068D1CEC=Are you trying to give me a complex?
0x068D1D14=I'd say that's another case closed!
0x068D1DF0=You make that sound like a bad thing!\nNow we can finally relax a little.
0x068D1E3C=Beuh...
0x068D1EC4=You're not going to say hello?
0x068D48B8=What's wrong?
0x068D48C8=You look pale...
0x068D48F8=Well...okay...
0x068D4908=You're imagining things.
0x068D4954=Nothing.
0x068D4A64=Let's go.
0x068D8C64=Heartless!\nThey must be after the device.
0x068D8CB0=This is the place.
0x068D8CD8=Wonder what this thing even does...
0x068DA480=What am I saying...\nThis isn't about them, or Xion.
0x068DA528=Have I got anything left?\nAny place I really belong?
0x068DA5A8=Why am I doing this?\nWhy am I going back to the castle?
0x068DA6AC=It's about me.\nWhatever “me” is.
0x068DA760=Any friends...I still belong with?
0x068DA790=How can I keep working for them if\nthey're gonna leave me in the dark?
0x068DA7D8=I feel like I'm the only person who\ndoesn't know.
0x068DA85C=There's nothing there for me.
0x068DBBD8=I coulda swore somebody was watchin'\nme... Next I'll be jumpin' at my own\nshadow.
0x068DBC38=(Ack!)
0x068DBCBC=Grrr... Great! I had to go and lose my\nplace! Now I gotta start lookin' from\nthe beginning.
0x068DBD18=Huh?
0x068DBD2C=Be careful not to let him out of your\nfield of vision, Roxas.
0x068DBD88=Hmm, he's sharper than he looks.
0x068DBE24=And obviously you'll need to stay out\nof his.
0x068DD298=I coulda swore somebody was watchin'\nme... Next I'll be jumpin' at my own\nshadow.
0x068DD2F8=(Ack!)
0x068DD384=Grrr... Great! I had to go and lose my\nplace! Now I gotta start lookin' from\nthe beginning.
0x068DD3E0=Huh?
0x068DD3F8=Be careful not to let him out of your\nfield of vision, Roxas.
0x068DD454=Hmm, he's sharper than he looks.
0x068DD4F4=And obviously you'll need to stay out\nof his.
0x068E1E14=Don't try and play dumb with me!
0x068E1E38=Hmph!\nHere for the magic lamp, are ya?
0x068E1E60=So you goons can keep your dirty mitts\noff!
0x068E1EF0=You listen up an' listen good!\nThat lamp is official property of Pete―\nthat's me! Ya got it?
0x068E1F60=Hey, who are you bozos!?
0x068E6760=Dear me! I mustn't make Her Highness\nwait―I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!
0x068E67AC=Oh, my fur and whiskers!\nI'm late, I'm late, for a very important\ndate!
0x068E68FC=No time to say goodbye― Hello...\nI'm late, I'm late, I'm late!
0x068E6940=What's his big rush?\nMaybe I should have a look up ahead.
0x068E9094=Down here.
0x068E90B4=Oh, I'm so late....\nI'm so very, very late!
0x068E90E0=Did he...shrink?
0x068E916C=Presumably...\nNow, I really would like to be getting\nback to my nap...
0x068E9324=Wait, you said he drank from a bottle.\nWhat bottle?
0x068E9380=He drank from the bottle, you see.
0x068E93A4=Of course... And a rather sleepy\ndoorknob at that.
0x068E9404=The one on the table.\nWhy don't you try?
0x068E9430=You mean those?
0x068E944C=A...talking doorknob?
0x068E94F8=Huh!? Who―
0x068E9508=The one with the blue label has a\npicture of a big tree shrinking...\nHere goes nothing.
0x068E956C=Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be going\nback to my nap.
0x068EBF00=Snrrrk... Phewww...
0x068EBF14=What's behind this door?
0x068EBF34=Roooooon... pchiiii...
0x068EBFF4=Whoa, it actually worked!
0x068EC054=Hey, that rabbit went through here a\nminute ago, right?
0x068EC08C=(Hmm, guess I won't be finding out\n anytime soon.)
0x068EC0C0=Hrrrnk... Phewww...
0x068EE108=(I wonder where that white rabbit went.\n He was sure in a hurry.)
0x068EFF84=So, we're here hunting specific game\ntoday, hmm?
0x068EFFB8=What? Oh, right.
0x068EFFE8=Er, right.
0x068F006C=It's whether or not you can jump on the\nchance when it arises that determines a\nman's fate.
0x068F00C8=No, I was here on a mission a little while\nago.
0x068F0194=What's wrong? First time here?
0x068F01B4=A rabbit? Really?
0x068F0234=And I ran into this white rabbit in a\nhuge hurry to get somewhere.
0x068F035C=I lost sight of him before I had a\nchance to see what the deal was,\nthough.
0x068F03A8=Let's get started.
0x068F03BC=Let's hope we stand up to the odds this\ntime around.
0x068F0444=Luck's like that.\nA window of opportunity can open and\nclose in the blink of an eye.
0x068F1D10=Huh? Who's there!?
0x068F1D60=Uhh...a cat?
0x068F1D70=What was that all about?
0x068F1D8C=A cheshire cat, if you please.\nOr if you don't.
0x068F1E34=I...I'll be asking the questions here!
0x068F1E94=Yes, of course.\nBut then, I also had none at all.\nWhich would you prefer?
0x068F1EE4=Lose something?
0x068F1F30=Well then, ask away...\nOf course, the answers may be a bit\ndifficult to find...
0x068F1F80=Who, indeed?
0x068F1FC4=Did you have a point?
0x068F3AB8=Naturally... But then it would be in my\nnature to lie.
0x068F3BA0=What do you mean?
0x068F3BB4=You know where the Heartless are?
0x068F3C00=Still, he gave us a nice reveal.
0x068F3C24=What a weird cat...
0x068F3C38=Whom did you expect?\nWhatever it is you're looking for?
0x068F3D0C=Come on.\nLet's go find those Heartless.
0x068F3D60=Looking for something?
0x068F3D78=Of course, the question is―should I lie\nabout in flowers, like the whats you're\nlooking for, or just lie about in words?
0x068F3E88=If I were you, I'd ask...me!
0x068F3EDC=Still no Pink Concertos...
0x068F3EF8=You again?
0x068F5434=Hmm... I wonder if you wonder where it\ncould be...
0x068F54A4=Mad enough to hide within a birdcage,\nperhaps? Or mad...like...me...
0x068F5594=Bravo! Bravo! It appears you've\nfound what you were looking for.
0x068F55D8=Of course, there's still one more to\nfind.
0x068F5604=We'd find it easy enough if you told us\nwhere to look, but I'm not holding my\nbreath.
0x068F571C=Oh, but you must!\nThat would be loads of fun! But then,\nyou'd have to be mad...
0x068F576C=That was helpful...
0x068F7244=That cat is a walking question mark.
0x068F7278=Nobody's going to reveal his hand from\nthe get-go.
0x068F72D4=How did you know where they'd be?\nAre you connected to the Heartless\nsomehow?
0x068F7384=Another mission down.
0x068F739C=Quite brilliant indeed!\nYour sight's been set and found again.
0x068F73DC=Game, set, and match.
0x068F7450=Yes, am I? Or aren't I?\nYou'll have to decide.
0x068F74B0=Heh. Let's head back, Roxas.
0x068F74D0=Well, excuse me.
0x068F7654=And frankly, I don't see you outwitting\nthat cat anytime soon.
0x068F76B8=You have to outwit your opponent in the\ngive and take to figure them out.
0x068F9BEC=Isn't that a little dramatic?
0x068F9C54=Following him won't change anything.\nWe're still here to hunt Heartless. 
0x068F9DE4=Let's go after our harried little hare,\nsee where he takes us.
0x068F9E30=Get too curious, though, and it'll be a\nshort walk.
0x068F9E64=Heh heh.\nWell, if you're that certain...
0x068F9F00=The one you mentioned the last time we\nwere here?
0x068F9F48=Well, curiosity is essential to carving\nyour own path through life.
0x068F9F8C=Yeah... What's got him so tense?\nI'm a little curious.
0x068F9FC4=You're okay with it, then?
0x068F9FFC=Following him won't change anything.\nYou said so yourself.
0x068FA078=No one can say whether following that\nrabbit's footsteps will be your lucky\ncharm...or get you killed.
0x068FA100=It's that rabbit.
0x068FA164=Even if she's curious, she's sure to be\nmost furious! For I'm late, I'm late,\nI'm late!
0x068FA2A8=I'm late! I'm late!\nI simply must get back. Oh dear!\nMy report is due post-haste!
0x068FCA18=Ahh... Perhaps we were right to chase\nyour busy bunny friend.
0x068FCA58=Looks like there's been trouble here.
0x068FCB4C=The Heartless we're after must be in\nthe one place they haven't looked yet.
0x068FCB98=Why's that?
0x068FCC78=Nrrrgh...
0x068FCC84=Then go! I want those suspicious\nscoundrels brought here to me.\nSentences must be served!
0x068FCCF0=Grrrrrr...
0x068FCD68=R-reporting in, Your Majesty! So far,\nour search has failed to turn up any\ntrio, including that which startled you.
0x068FCDDC=The only place left to look is in the\nroyal Rose Garden.
0x068FCE18=Time to get to work, Roxas.\nLet's uncover this tricky tierce. 
0x068FCE88=Yeah, bad time to drop in... Who's this\nsuspicious trio they're after? Are we\nnot the only outsiders here?
0x068FE3F0=There are odds for everything...\nThe trick is in the timing.
0x068FE43C=But there's a guard.
0x068FE474=Can't we?
0x068FE480=Hit the window just right, and a long\nshot will pay off big.
0x068FE504=Ohhh! So you mean if we wait till he's\nnot looking, we can probably sneak by.
0x068FE640=We can't get through.
0x068FEF04=There's a search on here for some\nsuspicious suspects, and you are in the\nway. Run along now, please.
0x068FFFFC=I'm betting on it.
0x06900030=So, this is the Queen's Rose Garden...\nIt's like a maze.
0x0690013C=Now, let's get looking.
0x06900180=A suspicious trio...\nYou really think she meant our\nHeartless?
0x069001D0=Our marks are in here somewhere.
0x06901974=Let's head back, Roxas.
0x069019FC=And all the way to the grave.
0x06901A1C=Cheery thought...
0x06901A30=You STILL haven't found them!?\nSomeone's head will roll for this!
0x06901B4C=In the end, your curiosity paved us a\nshortcut.
0x06901B7C=Now, for one last shortcut.
0x06901B98=So it was the Heartless, then.
0x06901BB8=The key to carving a path through life,\nhuh?
0x06901CDC=I think our luck beat theirs today.
0x06901D44=Yeah... But wait. If we just took out the\ntrio those card soldiers are searching\nfor, what will they―
0x06901E38=All the searching in the world won't help\nthem now.
0x06901E6C=Super...
0x06905300=Heh. Don't tempt fate.\nYou'll send Lady Luck running with talk\nlike that.
0x069053B0=Time to ante up and play.
0x069053CC=Yet another mission here.
0x0690540C=Let's hope things go as smoothly this\ntime around.
0x06907684=Wait... The next maze?\nThere's more than one?
0x069076B4=A “new shadow,” is it?\nHmm...
0x069076D8=Oh, didn't you know?\nHere, a maze is a maze of mazes.
0x06907758=STILL nothing!?\nIf I lose my temper...one of you will\nlose your head! Understand!?
0x069077D0=Are they still searching for the\nHeartless we took out last time?
0x06907848=Isn't that amazing!?
0x06907860=Unless, of course, they decide to look\nfor the new shadow that's appeared.
0x06907910=But that seems unlikely to me, does it\nto you?
0x06907950=Let's check the maze for those\nswitches, Roxas.
0x06907980=Not quite. I've one more quick quip.\nIf four switches you trip...the new\nshadow unzips!
0x06907A54=Right.
0x06907A5C=You might say they'll look for\nabsolutely nothing until they find it.
0x06907ACC=He's gone...
0x06907B8C=And if they don't find it here, perhaps\nthey'll find it there...in the next maze.
0x06908F48=That should be all of them.
0x06908FE0=That leaves three...
0x06908FF8=Two to go.
0x06909004=Just one more.
0x06909028=Oh no!\nI forgot the assembly!
0x0690A148=That should be all of them.
0x0690A1E0=That leaves three...
0x0690A1F8=Two to go.
0x0690A204=Just one more.
0x0690A228=Oh no!\nI forgot the assembly!
0x0690B348=That should be all of them.
0x0690B3E0=That leaves three...
0x0690B3F8=Two to go.
0x0690B404=Just one more.
0x0690B428=Oh no!\nI forgot the assembly!
0x0690C548=That should be all of them.
0x0690C5E0=That leaves three...
0x0690C5F8=Two to go.
0x0690C604=Just one more.
0x0690C628=Oh no!\nI forgot the assembly!
0x0690DC90=I don't see any shadow.
0x0690DCA8=...to look in the room with the napping\nknob.
0x0690DCD8=Now the lights are lit, the shadow's\npermit to come out and play.\n“Hooray!” I say.
0x0690DD30=Oh, but today's the day I might.\nToday's the day to say your job's...
0x0690DE3C=How wonderful!\nHow simply wonderful!
0x0690DF14=Well, the lights aren't lit here.\nThey're lit over there.
0x0690DFC0=Over where!?\n...Never mind, I know you won't tell us.
0x0690FDE4=Let's head back, Roxas.
0x06912C6C=You might say I do, or you might say I\ndon't. What do you say?
0x06912CAC=All alone today, are you?
0x06912D00=I say see you around.\nI've got work to do. I have to go.
0x06912D3C=Indeed, but to find this shadow you\nmust scour the shade.
0x06912DAC=Look, did you have something to tell me?\nBecause if not―
0x06912EA0=Ahh, but go where?\nTo see the large shadow, perhaps?
0x06912F88=There's a Heartless here?
0x069151E4=It's nearly here now. Are you quite\nprepared? If not, well...good-bye...
0x0691947C=The shadow's no more―even it can't\nshine in the light.
0x069194B8=Up to me?
0x069194EC=Bravo! Bravo!
0x069195F0=Why, yes. Once you believe, the truth\nand a lie are quite the same thing.
0x069196C4=Let your heart decide―it's in your\nheart you must confide.
0x0691972C=Neither...or both...\nIt's quite up to you.
0x06919788=Are you a friend or an enemy?
0x069197F0=Easy for him to say...\nHow am I supposed to do that when I\ndon't have a heart?
0x06919840=I have no idea what to believe in.
0x06919864=So who are you, anyway?\nIf you're going to help me, why talk in\nriddles?
0x0691B4E8=Oh dear, I'm here... I should be there!\nI'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
0x0691C0C0=This garden belongs to the Queen.\nAnd it's private. No trespassing.\nThank you.
0x0691D524=Ack! If I'm late again, the Queen is\nsure to say, “Off with your head!”
0x0691D57C=Hurry up! Don't be late!
0x0691DED0=Heh heh, it seems the house here is a\nstickler for rules.
0x0691DF90=What was that all about?
0x0691DFD0=My guess is they're headed to see that\nqueen of theirs.
0x0692135C=It came from inside...\nMaybe it's the Heartless I'm after?
0x069213D4=This is the castle...
0x0692141C=I guess I'll find out.\nTime to head in and take a look.
0x06921454=What was that roar?
0x06922DCC=It's awfully quiet...\nIs nobody home?
0x06922E40=There's my target!
0x069250B8=What?
0x06925120=I heard this roar. Like an animal...\nA big one.
0x06925150=Really? What was it?
0x06925170=I don't know.\nI guess we may find out today.
0x069251A0=I guess.
0x069251E8=We'd better be careful not to let\nanybody here see us.
0x069252D0=Yeah, I mean...last time I was here,\nthe place seemed deserted. All I heard\nwas― Never mind.
0x06925330=You guess?
0x06925360=I guess so!\nWell, let's get started.
0x0692539C=Right.
0x069253FC=We have to investigate this castle\ntoday, right?
0x06927918=Sounds crazy, but...maybe.
0x06927978=Beats me.
0x069279B4=So you figure it's one of the castle's\nservants?
0x06927A10=Oh, come on...
0x06927A90=What did you see?
0x06927AA4=Would you believe...a walking, talking\ncandelabra?
0x06927B28=Roxas!
0x06927B30=The master is in quite an unfortunate mood today.
0x06927B84=I heard it too.
0x06927C58=Whoa, you weren't kidding.\nBut...how can it...
0x06927C94=But it did say something about a master.
0x06927CD0=If only he would leave his chambers...
0x0692991C=Hmm?
0x069299C4=(Uh-oh!)
0x069299F0=How strange...\nThe light―it must be playing tricks on\nme... Heh heh.
0x0692C274=This is MY castle!\nAnd it is MY wish!
0x0692C29C=Graaaaaaugh!
0x0692C2AC=Wh-what was that?
0x0692C2FC=Graaaaaaugh!\nHow dare she not join me for dinner!
0x0692C330=Think this is the master's room?
0x0692C410=(“My castle”? Is he serious?)
0x0692C484=Maybe just barging in is a bad idea.
0x0692C4EC=(Wh-what IS that thing!?)
0x0692C5FC=Can you get a look at what's going on\ninside from here?
0x0692DBE8=Well, Roxas?
0x0692DC74=I don't know, but get away from the\ndoor. I don't want him to see us here.
0x0692DCF0=Whoa... What is he?
0x0692DDA4=There was a...weird monster inside.
0x069312F0=He mentioned a master.\nYou think he's a servant here in the\ncastle?
0x06931334=Is that a...
0x069313D8=Yeah, we'll have to keep out of sight\nwhile we take out Heartless.
0x0693141C=Maybe.
0x069314F8=Sigh... She doesn't seem to have made any difference.\nThe master's temper is as bad as ever.
0x06931558=Yup. A walking clock.
0x069315C4=If only he would make an attempt to be\nsuave or genteel. Surely then he'd\nsee...
0x06931618=Well, what are we going to do?\nThe way he's pacing around...
0x069316A4=Hide.
0x06931710=Someone's coming.
0x06932C64=(Uh-oh!)
0x06932CEC=How peculiar. I could have sworn...\nOh well. Perhaps the master's finally\ndriven me to distraction...
0x06932D54=Mmm?
0x069340B4=Let's head out through this hall.
0x069340D8=The Heartless we're after is called a\nNeoshadow, right? I hope we don't wind\nup searching all day.
0x06936048=Good point.
0x0693608C=You're assuming Belle's human.
0x06936180=If they don't...I shall be a table\ndecoration forever!
0x06936200=He said something about getting her and\nthe master to forgive each other.\nI guess they've been arguing.
0x069362B4=So far nobody else seems to be.
0x069362D4=So this Belle person lives here in the\ncastle.
0x06936454=Right.
0x0693647C=It's that candelabra.
0x06936494=No―I will speak to Mademoiselle Belle.\nPerhaps she can talk some sense into\nhim...
0x069364EC=Well, we're not here to worry about her.\nLet's find the Heartless we're after.
0x06936564=Yeah, the one we saw before.
0x069365F0=She'd have to be brave to stand up to\na beast like that.
0x0693662C=Surely there must be some way to get\nBelle and the master to forgive each\nother...
0x06936698=I don't get it.\nThe candelabra doesn't want to be a\ncandelabra?
0x0693831C=Hmm?
0x069383C4=(Uh-oh!)
0x069383F0=How strange...\nThe light―it must be playing tricks on\nme... Heh heh.
0x06939FFC=Roxas, up there!
0x0693A048=Let's take it out.
0x0693E304=Graaaaaaugh!
0x0693E314=Apparently.
0x0693E328=Right...?
0x0693E334=Waouh...
0x0693E378=What do you mean?
0x0693E3F8=And Xemnas is our master, right?
0x0693E548=Exactly. I figured it worked like that\neverywhere. I thought that's what\nbeing master meant.
0x0693E5A8=Right.
0x0693E620=But if Heartless showed up in our\ncastle, we'd be the ones to get rid of\nthem, not Xemnas.
0x0693E698=I don't know that I'd call us Xemnas's\nservants, exactly...
0x0693E6D4=Like what?
0x0693E70C=Let's call it a day, Roxas.\nAxel's probably waiting.
0x0693E758=But you're right.\nIf he's taking the Heartless on himself,\nhe must have a good reason.
0x0693E7B0=Well, yeah. That's our job.
0x0693E7CC=Yeah.
0x0693E808=Like...maybe he has something he wants\nto protect.
0x0693E83C=Mission accomplie.
0x0693E850=That beast is the master here, right?
0x0693E878=After all, he's got servants here.
0x0693E89C=Hmm...
0x0693E8B4=Huh!?
0x0693E974=Mission accomplished.
0x0693E98C=So he has been fighting the Heartless.
0x0693EA20=The Heartless do not belong here―\nnot in my castle!
0x0693EAAC=Guess this castle plays by different\nrules than ours.
0x0693EAE4=He shouldn't have to fight.
0x0693EBA8=Whoa...
0x0693EBC0=Ready to head back?\nWe can stop for ice cream and―
0x069415EC=There has to be some way to bring the\ntwo of them together!
0x06941628=We have to slip by here without being\nseen.
0x069416B8=True...
0x06941724=The clock...
0x06941734=The servants seem awfully interested in\nmaking sure Belle and their master get\nalong.
0x0694178C=Well, let's just focus on our target.
0x0694188C=Only that they seem to be in such a rush\nabout it.
0x069418C0=You think it's strange?
0x06941940=Remember the last time we were here?\nThe candelabra was talking about the\nsame thing.
0x06941998=Right.
0x069419B4=Those horrid creatures plaguing the\ncastle have kept the master from\nseeing Belle for days...
0x06941A94=He mentioned Belle.
0x06943360=How curious... I was certain... Hmph!\nPull yourself together, Cogsworth.\nThe whole castle is enchanted, after all.
0x069434B0=(Uh-oh!)
0x069434DC=Mmm?
0x0694539C=Nothing yet... Sorry.
0x069453BC=I'm sorry, Roxas...\nMy taking your Keyblade must make\nthings harder for you.
0x0694540C=It's fine.\nNo need to worry about me.
0x069454A4=How about you?\nHas using it jogged your memory at all?
0x06945538=Yeah...\nThanks, Roxas.
0x0694555C=Any time!
0x06945668=Look! Over there!
0x0694568C=That's our Heartless!\nYou ready, Xion?
0x069456DC=I'm sure it'll come back to you soon.\nDon't sweat it.
0x06945768=Don't be.
0x069490D8=You've seen him, haven't you?\nEvery inch a monster.
0x0694919C=If you say so.
0x0694925C=We'll leave the beast's chambers for\nlater. Let's search the rest of the\ncastle first.
0x069492FC=Wow...\nThat can't be fun.
0x069493E0=So you've done a little exploring here\non your own, then.
0x0694941C=The castle's master?
0x06949434=The data we've collected suggests he\nwas human, originally.
0x069494B4=Hmph, still as dark and empty as ever.\nIt's practically a cave. A fitting home\nfor a beast.
0x06949528=The exact sequence of events is\nunclear, but it was a spell that forced\nhim to live as that...thing.
0x069495A8=A spell?
0x069495B4=All right.
0x069496D4=Yes... I suspect it was some kind of\nspell that left him in that state.
0x0694AF80=Wait... Something is there.
0x0694AF9C=What indeed? Let's continue our search.\nAnd stay out of sight.
0x0694B0B4=You think he's under the spell, too?
0x0694B168=Ah, but you see?\nThis is one of the castle's residents.\nAnd like the beast, a human once.
0x0694B1C4=This can't go on much longer...\nWe're running out of time!
0x0694B200=What happens when time runs out?
0x0694B340=Another day of the master skulking\nabout the castle, chasing down those\ncreatures...
0x0694B398=If I had to venture a guess.\nAnd from the sound of it, this spell\ncame with a time limit.
0x0694B3F4=Running out of time for what?
0x0694B420=At this rate, he'll go the entire day\nwithout speaking to Belle at all... Again.
0x0694C528=(Uh-oh!)
0x0694C5A8=I was certain that something was\nthere... Lumiere! If that's you, get\nback to your post this instant!
0x0694C610=Mmm?
0x0694D634=This is the beast's room?
0x0694D650=Your words don't inspire much\nconfidence. Go on, take a look inside.
0x0694D728=Should be...
0x0694E12C=I wish there were some way I could\nhelp.
0x0694E178=I wonder if he's off chasing those\nhorrid creatures again. He's had to do\nthat every day for weeks...
0x0694E1E0=I'm sure that together we can figure\nsomething out.
0x0694E258=Perhaps I'll ask Cogsworth and the\nothers.
0x0694EE40=I'm sure.\nTry not to embarrass yourself further.
0x0694EEBC=Hmph, useless.\nNot even fit to act as a guide, are you?
0x0694EEF4=I just got a little turned around.\nThe beast's room is this way.
0x0694EFB0=Oops.
0x0694EFB8=Oups.
0x0694F05C=Guess I had the wrong room.
0x069509C4=I couldn't say. We may find some clue in\nthe beast's room.
0x06950A00=Stop. We're not alone.
0x06950B2C=If only there was some way we could be\nrid of them for good...
0x06950BBC=Then let us be going.\nDon't get spotted, Roxas.
0x06950CE8=It is horrible...\nThis monstrous infestation has to end!
0x06950D24=It would seem everyone here underwent\nsome sort of transformation.
0x06950DD8=He must be like the others―another\nhuman under the spell.
0x06950E64=That's just past here.
0x06950E7C=How do you suppose they wound up\nunder a spell?
0x06950EAC=But like this... What can I do!?\nI don't even have arms to hold a\nsword!
0x06951E28=Hmm?
0x06951EC4=(Uh-oh!)
0x06951EE8=Cogsworth! Is that you?
0x06952798=This is the beast's room?
0x06952854=Yeah. I'll take a look inside...
0x069539B4=Ça alors...
0x069539C4=There's something at the far side of the\nroom...
0x06953A0C=My, my...
0x06953A54=Huh!?\nXaldin, how did you...
0x06953A74=This rose... I sense a power in it.\nThe beast must hold it quite dear.
0x06953B20=Looks like he's out...
0x069558C8=I'd like to keep this quick.\nDon't drag your heels, Roxas.
0x069566D4=Hmph... Weaklings.\nCome, Roxas. We'll end them here.
0x0695701C=Enough dallying.\nWe've wasted enough time here as it is.
0x06957074=Let's find our target and be done with it.
0x06957150=Whew...\nThat takes care of them.
0x06958DDC=There you are...\nLet's begin.
0x06958F3C=Look at the size of it!
0x0695C1D0=Hmm, I wonder.\nCome. We'll take a look.
0x0695C23C=Graaaaaaugh!
0x0695C24C=Hmph... Toothless.
0x0695C36C=It came from his room...\nDid something happen?
0x0695C39C=What was that!?
0x0695C3CC=Right.
0x0695C3F4=Come, Roxas.\nOur mission is over.
0x0695C418=Our beastly host, I'd imagine.
0x0695D790=It's related to the spell?
0x0695D7AC=Graaaaaaaaaugh!
0x0695D86C=No! I can't bear it―I don't even want\nto think about it!
0x0695D8E8=What do you mean?
0x0695D9BC=How fascinating. Then his beastly form\nmust be tied to it somehow.
0x0695DAB8=One of his servants did mention\nsomething about time running out.
0x0695DAFC=The key to his cursed form...\nHeh heh, this morsel will prove useful.
0x0695DB44=The last rose petal is about to fall...\nWhen it does, I'll lose―
0x0695DB88=Yes. It seems if he doesn't complete\nsome task in the rose's lifetime, he\nstays a beast.
0x0695DC40=I'd only waste my time attempting to\nexplain it to you. Come along. We must\nreturn.
0x0695DCEC=The rose?
0x0695EDA4=Graaaaaaaaaugh!
0x0695EDB4=That was the beast...\nDid something happen?
0x0695EDE0=Whoa!
0x0695FD4C=Graaaaaaaaaugh!
0x0695FDF4=That sounded close...\nBy the bridge!?
0x06960E38=Ah...
0x06960E84=Huh?
0x06960E98=(What...what's out there?)
0x06960EE0=(What could do this to him?)
0x069670D4=(He was protecting the people in the\n castle.)
0x06967104=(Someone's coming.)
0x06967118=But they're gone.\nYou don't have to fight any more.
0x0696714C=But you don't have a heart.\nHow would you know?
0x0696717C=They think the power of love will save\nthem? That's the stuff of poetry, not\npracticality.
0x069671D8=If something were to happen to you...\nI don't know what I'd...
0x06967218=(But...Xaldin said it was the rose.)
0x069673BC=(She's what matters most to him.)
0x069673E4=A master protects his castle...\nI don't want to lose you.
0x06967474=I have eyes, and a brain.\nWe have no further business here.\nTry not to dawdle.
0x069674C4=I'm taking you with me.
0x069674DC=Please―you must stop doing this.\nIt's too much.
0x06967534=Where does its power come from?
0x06967554=Xaldin... When did you get here?
0x069675F4=Nor will they, for long. The love\nbetween them will wither and die.\nLove never lasts.
0x06967700=......\nBelle... Get back inside...\nIt's too dangerous...
0x0696773C=Good... That's good. I managed to keep\nthem from...getting in...
0x06967780=Is love fighting to protect what's\nimportant to you?
0x069677B8=It's an emotion.\nThe one deluding those two as we speak.
0x06967800=(Protecting her.)
0x06967820=Feh. Cloying nonsense.
0x069678C4=Love? What's that?
0x06967918=That still doesn't explain what love is...
0x069679D0=I'm right here...
0x069679E4=No! Oh, no!
0x06967A20=(So he wasn't fighting to protect the\n rose.)
0x06967AB8=What happened? Are you all right...
0x06967B40=That's none of your concern.
0x06967BE0=(Et elle...)
0x06967CB0=Belle... I couldn't bear to see you...\nor the others hurt.
0x06967CEC=Hmph. Love, from a beast?\nHow utterly ridiculous.
0x06967D68=Love is a power?
0x06967D88=Ah...
0x06967D90=No...\nI have to stop...those things...
0x06967DB8=Oh...
0x06968C28=All right, Xaldin... Where are you?
0x0696A350=He could still be around somewhere.\nI should keep looking.
0x0696A38C=Hmm... I wonder if it has anything to do\nwith that stranger Mrs. Potts spotted\nin the castle.
0x0696A3EC=That sounds like Xaldin, all right.
0x0696A410=No, I am completely in the dark...
0x0696A458=Still, the possibility remains.\nWe must sweep the castle for signs of\nthis man immediately!
0x0696A4D0=Lumiere, the master is out of sorts―\nagain. Have you any idea what it is this\ntime?
0x0696A528=Yes. She said it was a man in a black\ncoat with black hair.
0x0696A7EC=And you suspect he may have\nantagonized the master? Surely no one\nwould be so foolish.
0x0696A874=A stranger, you say?
0x0696B8D0=Why do I get the feeling this has\nsomething to do with Xaldin...
0x0696B960=The beast has been acting strange?
0x0696B990=He just isn't himself lately...\nI wonder what's happened.
0x0696B9D8=I'll go ask the others. Maybe they know\nof some way I can help.
0x0696D4AC=Maybe he's in here.
0x0696D4F8=Xaldin seemed awfully interested in the\nbeast...
0x0696D5C8=(He, who? Xaldin?)
0x0696D5DC=Belle, betray me? He said she would\ntake everything from me.
0x0696D628=It sounds like Xaldin made some kind of\ncontact.
0x0696D65C=No... I won't believe it.\nHe must have been lying.
0x0696D6E8=That's not possible. I trust her!
0x0696D70C=Then he might still be somewhere in the\ncastle...
0x0696F324=It won't be long now.\nThings here should become quite\ninteresting.
0x0696F368=What's kept you here so long?
0x0696F400=Roxas... Why are you here?
0x0696F43C=A shame you've wasted your time.\nWe return immediately.
0x0696F474=Fine...
0x0696F4E8=You never RTC'd from your last mission.\nI came to get you.
0x0696F548=Ha, on aura tout vu...
0x0696F5B4=Xaldin!
0x0696F5D4=(Is that why he made contact with the\n beast?)
0x0696F608=Hmph. How presumptuous.
0x0696F648=Just making a few preparations.
0x0696F668=Preparations for what?
0x06973800=I'd better call it a day.
0x06973844=Hmm...
0x0697384C=Mission accomplished.\nTime to RTC.
0x06973878=Huh!?
0x069738A8=What was that?\nAnother Heartless?
0x069738F8=Or...something besides the Heartless?
0x06973964=Well, Saïx's orders were to RTC as\nsoon as the mission was done.
0x069748C4=Mission accomplished.\nTime to head back.
0x0698BB4C=Heh heh... Elite?\nAs if.
0x0698BB68=New recruits? What kind of people does\nthe Organization look for?
0x0698BBAC=Nobodies.
0x0698BBB8=Well, say this person's heart is strong―\nreal strong. Sometimes, you wind up\nwith a sort of byproduct: a Nobody.
0x0698BC48=What are we investigating?
0x0698BC64=What? Why?
0x0698BE38=You and Xion are the real exceptional\nones.
0x0698BE64=Bingo. You know somebody turns into a\nHeartless if the darkness gets their\nheart, right?
0x0698BF20=You mean...with a capital N.
0x0698BF58=I didn't know everybody was such an\nelite...
0x0698BF88=Take the strongest of those―the real\ncream of the crop―stick 'em in a room,\nand you've got us: the Organization.
0x0698C000=We're investigating what's to\ninvestigate. Maybe there's new recruits\naround.
0x0698C05C=All right. Let's make with the\ninvestigating and haul it back home.
0x0698D9A8=Wuh-oh. Looks like conversation hour's\nover. Time to tidy up, Roxas.
0x069909E0=By the way, nice moves back there.\nHerc told me you had potential.
0x06990A7C=Roxas.
0x06990A84=I should do some recon here first,\nbefore heading into the Coliseum.
0x06990ACC=What took you so long!?\nI got everything set up!
0x06990B28=Here to train, I know!\nSave your breath, kid. You're gonna\nneed it.
0x06990B6C=I'm sure you'll be the best wannabe\nhero they've ever had.
0x06990C50=Um, Roxas.
0x06990C5C=Well, yeah, but...
0x06990C70=What? But I'm―
0x06990C84=Xigbar!\nWhy'd you leave me like that?
0x06990D84=Um, no!?\nI think you've got the wrong guy.\nXigbar, tell him―
0x06990DE0=Wow, Roxas.\nMoonlighting as a wannabe hero now?
0x06990E10=Your fighting's better than your\nstandup routine, kid. Stick to what you\nknow. You got a name?
0x06990E88=Wannabe?\nWhat's that supposed to mean?
0x06990EB0=You don't have to sneak around now\nthat you're one of them.
0x06990F54=Okay, Roxas. I gotta go double check\nthe training equipment.
0x06991024=Meet me inside the Coliseum when you're\nready―and don't take all day!
0x06991078=C'mon, hop to it. You wanna be a hero,\nand that takes time.
0x06991178=There you are!\nI been waitin' for you!
0x069911A0=Ugh, fine.\nI'll handle this myself.
0x069911D0=As if. I just don't want to get in the way\nof your valuable training. I care about\nyour future, Roxas.
0x06991320=Still, this worked out pretty well,\nwouldn't you say?
0x06991358=To hide, duh! In case you forgot, the\nOrganization runs a stealth operation.
0x069913B4=Heh, what indeed?
0x069913D0=Hope you came ready to sweat, kid!
0x069913F4=How do you figure that?
0x069914EC=Xigbar!?\nWhere'd you...
0x06991554=Gotta hand it to him, he's got an eye\nfor talent! I don't coach just anybody,\nya know.
0x06991714=Hey, you're bailing on me?
0x06991730=Huh?
0x069922E4=Nein
0x069922F4=You ready for training, kid?
0x06992324=Finally!\nLet's get started already!
0x06992D08= points...\nThat's incredible, kid!\nYou sure you're a rookie!?
0x06993538= points...\nNot bad, kid! Not bad at all!
0x06993578=Next time, I want you to go for 200\npoints.
0x06993F48= points...\nAbout what I'd expect.
0x06993F70=Try for 150 points next time, all right?
0x069949C4=Next time, go for 100 points minimum!
0x06994A30= points...\nWell, we'll just hope you got a steep\nlearning curve.
0x06995234=Nein
0x069952B0=Wanna take another crack at it?
0x069972F8=Keep up this pace, and you'll do just\nfine, kid!
0x06997388=League.
0x06997390=So the Games are like a tournament?\nDo I get to enter?
0x069973C8=The champ in these parts is my prize\nstudent. Maybe you've seen him in the\nColiseum before?
0x069974AC=I got two words for you, kid.
0x06997500=Not too bad for your first time in the\nColiseum.
0x069975A0=Outta.
0x069975A8=Which is good, because we need all the\nhelp we can get...
0x0699762C=So there aren't any strong people\naround here?
0x06997698=You? In the Games!?\nAhh ha ha ha!
0x06997778=Wait, are you sayin' you signed up for\nhero training without even knowing\nwhat the Games are!?
0x069977E4=They fight, people come to watch, and\nthat is what this whole place is for!
0x06997830=Your.
0x069978E0=With back-to-back matches in the Games\nand taking out the Heartless, our\nchamp's been workin' way too much.
0x06997958=At least until those Heartless started\nshowin' up in droves.
0x06997998=Help with what?\nWhy are you looking for new people to\ntrain here, anyway?
0x069979E4=I guess you could say we're\nunderstaffed.
0x06997A78=You got promise, I'll give you that.\nBut you'll need a lot more training\nbefore you're ready for the big time.
0x06997AEC=All right, Roxas.\nLet's call it a day.
0x06997B88=Oy... Lemme break it down easy for ya,\nkid. There's a hero and a ginormous\nmonster...
0x06997D14=What are you, crazy!?\nWe got ourselves a bona fide hero!
0x06997D50=What does he do here?
0x06997D68=What's so funny about that?
0x06998C6C=Hey, Phil!\nI'm back!
0x06998C84=It's about time, Herc. That new trainee\nyou scouted showed up already.
0x06998D4C=He probably just couldn't wait to start\ntraining with yours truly. Not that I can\nblame him.
0x06998E5C=The kid's got guts, I'll give him that.\nWait'll you hear this...
0x06998EC4=Really? Wow. He said it would take him\nawhile to get here. He must've made\nrecord time!
0x06999BF8=Hmm, I'm not on recon today, so I\nshould probably steer clear of the\nColiseum.
0x06999D04=All I have to do is defeat some\nHeartless and then I can head home.
0x0699B97C=Get.
0x0699B984=What!?
0x0699B9A8=Hey, hold on.\nLet me give ya two words of advice.
0x0699B9E4=We got a Heartless situation in the\nColiseum!
0x0699BA14=Baisse
0x0699BA44=Roxas!\nYou have got good timing, kid!
0x0699BAA4=I know this is no job for a rookie, but I\nain't got much of a choice!
0x0699BAEC=I will.
0x0699BAF4=This is the real deal, so stay sharp.
0x0699BB60=You heard me.\nAnd Herc's nowhere to be found!
0x0699BC6C=Careless!
0x0699BC78=Don't.
0x0699BD10=Um, right.
0x0699D42C=You're serious about gettin' into the big\nleagues, right?
0x0699D478=Let me know as soon as you're ready.
0x0699D4B8=Train.
0x0699D4EC=What?
0x0699D4F8=Day!
0x0699D500=Every.
0x0699D600=No “buts,” kid!\nNow get training!
0x0699D628=Now that you're warmed up, how about\nstartin' in on today's training?
0x0699D6CC=But I'm telling you, I'm not―
0x0699D6EC=Nice going.\nYou looked pretty good out there!
0x0699D728=Um, thanks...
0x0699D738=Well, there are two things every hero\nhopeful has to remember.
0x0699E100=Nein
0x0699E168=You all set to train, kid?
0x0699E194=All right, let's get this show on the\nroad.
0x0699F0E8=(Well, I've collected enough hearts.\n I guess I'll RTC.)
0x0699F174=All right.\nThat's enough for today.
0x0699F218=Uh-huh?\nCould really what?
0x0699F234=Ya know, you could really...
0x0699F264=Actually, it's more than enough.\nBetween givin' that Heartless pest a\npounding and all the training you put in...
0x0699F308=Could really use more practice.\nTrust me. You're gonna need it.
0x069A0014=Too late. The new rookie took care of\n'em. I'm tellin' ya, Champ, the kid ain't\nhalf bad!
0x069A0100=Where ya been, Herc!?\nWe been drownin' in Heartless while\nyou were off Zeus-knows-where!
0x069A019C=Heartless? Where?\nLet me at 'em, Phil!
0x069A01C4=Phil! I'm back!
0x069A2E58=I'll handle the Heartless out here.\nYou take the ones inside.
0x069A2EBC=We'll find the Heartless in here.
0x069A2F6C=It's that, or stay out here.
0x069A3038=We'll split up!\nAnd, uh...form two strike forces!
0x069A306C=Would it kill them to give me a recon\nmission or...I don't know, something\nun-violent?
0x069A30C4=I guess?
0x069A30E8=(And while you collect those hearts,\n maybe I can collect some Z's...)
0x069A3130=(The Coliseum's our best bet for\n finding a whole pack of Heartless at\n once.)
0x069A318C=Don't worry. We'll just say you're\nanother aspiring hero here for some\ntraining.
0x069A31E0=Follow me, Demyx.
0x069A31F4=Wait, training!? That sounds like work,\nwhich means sweating. Which is gross.
0x069A32CC=Covering a broader range means more\nefficient collection, right?
0x069A3310=Hmm, actually...
0x069A334C=Yeah!
0x069A3424=Nothing!\nWell, good luck in there, Roxas.
0x069A3530=What?
0x069A3564=What's the matter?
0x069A3578=Trust me, it'll be fine.
0x069A3594=We're out on heart collection today,\nright? Sigh... I'm so not cut out for\ncombat.
0x069A360C=Okay, right on...\nOoh, but should we just go waltzing in?\nWon't someone see?
0x069A4254=C'mon! Is that all you got!?\nYou call yourself a hero and use form\nlike that?
0x069A42A4=It's coming from the arena.
0x069A432C=Huh? He's not here...
0x069A60FC=I'm still not done.
0x069A6110=Why's he getting yelled at like that\nwhen he's doing such a solid job?\nIs he that much stronger than me?
0x069A61FC=I finished early, so I thought I'd drop\nby and see how you were doing.
0x069A6250=All right, next exercise!\nKeep moving! No breaks!
0x069A62C8=C'mon, you can take more than this!
0x069A638C=Done with all the Heartless outside\nalready?
0x069A63BC=I'd be running out the door in tears\nafter ten minutes of that.
0x069A6590=Yeah? Well, no biggie!\nI'll just find a comfy spot and kick back\nfor a while.
0x069A6608=Put some zing into it!\nStay focused!
0x069A6654=That guy is getting trained way harder\nthan I was.
0x069A6688=Blegh... What a tyrant!
0x069A66A8=Demyx?
0x069A6700=The what? Oh, right, uh...yeah!\nYeah, they sure picked the wrong guy\nto mess with!
0x069A77BC=Um, okay.
0x069A77E4=All right, Herc. That's it for today.\nRest up for the next one!
0x069A787C=Hey, there's my rookie!\nReady for today's training, kid?\nJust say the word.
0x069A80E4=Nein
0x069A8104=All right, let's get started!
0x069A8194=You ready to train, kid?
0x069AA348=I gotta tell ya, kid.\nI'm impressed.
0x069AA370=You just worry about getting in shape\nfor the tournament. I got two words of\nadvice for ya...
0x069AA3D0=Yup. You can try for the Rookie Cup,\nanyway.
0x069AA448=You are!?
0x069AA458=Ahem...\nEnough talk about Herc.
0x069AA478=Huh?
0x069AA480=Of all the heroes I've trained, he's\nspecial. Maybe the best.
0x069AA5C0=Train!
0x069AA5F4=Why were you working him so much\nharder than you do me?
0x069AA6B4=I think you're ready for the big time.\nSo, I'm clearing ya to enter the Games!
0x069AA770=Is he that strong?
0x069AA790=I got high hopes for him.\nHe's gonna be “the one”!
0x069AA7E4=Nice work.\nThat's a good run for one day.
0x069AA86C=In the meantime, we'll keep you up to\nyour elbows in training―so stay sharp!
0x069AA918=(The Organization expects me to do hard\n missions all the time.)
0x069AA95C=Eat.
0x069AA964=Remember, I got expectations for you\ntoo, kid.
0x069AA9B0=And it's not just that.
0x069AAA00=I figure, you may not place, but at least\nyou'll put up a decent show.
0x069AAAA4=Oh, Herc? He's another student of mine.\nBeen at it a long time now.
0x069AAAE8=Sleep.
0x069AAAF0=(Aren't expectations the same thing as\n orders?)
0x069AAB24=(So people work you harder when they\n have expectations?)
0x069AAC80=Speaking of which, who was that you\nwere training before me?
0x069AACC0=Well, sure. He's a hero, kid.\nIf I put a squirt like you through that,\nyou'd croak on me.
0x069AAD6C=Manger
0x069AC330=But aren't you expected to?
0x069AC34C=Huh? Yeah...
0x069AC408=Ha, they know better than that.\nThey wanna keep the machine running,\nthey pick the right tool for the job.
0x069AC574=Hey, Roxas. You done?
0x069AC58C=Nah, it's rare that I do anything that\nstrenuous.
0x069AC600=Something happen in there, man?
0x069AC620=What kind of missions do you usually\nwork?
0x069AC664=And that's me?\nThe right tool for the job?
0x069AC6F4=Me? Recon stuff, mostly.
0x069AC710=No taking out Heartless?
0x069AC778=What's up, man?\nYou look out of it.
0x069AC7A0=No, I just― Nothing.\nOur mission's complete. Let's RTC.
0x069AE560=It's because I'm partnered up with you\nI keep getting saddled with these\ncombat missions!
0x069AE61C=Then let's move out.
0x069AE634=Wanna split up the search like last time?
0x069AE6E8=Heartless duty again today?
0x069AE7B0=Are you crazy!?\nAnd risk actually finding that thing?\nI'm not fighting it alone!
0x069AE804=I keep telling them I'm not cut out for\nthis stuff...
0x069AE83C=This time we're after a specific target.
0x069AE868=Yeesh...\nIs it too late to go home?
0x069AE968=Saïx said it was strong.
0x069AF7A8=I'm gonna stay out here and, uh...guard\nthe exit, yeah! Nobody's exiting on my\nwatch. (Except maybe me...)
0x069B0994=Don't worry. I already got you signed up\nfor the Games.
0x069B0A3C=Big day?
0x069B0A90=(They're holding the Games today?\n Then the only way I can search the\n Coliseum is by entering.)
0x069B0AF8=I've been waitin' for ya, kid!\nToday's the big day, huh?
0x069B0B54=But― All right...
0x069B0B80=Now you just gotta go in there and put\nall that training to use!
0x069B0C58=Snap out of it, kid!\nI need you sharp out there.\nJust tell me when you're ready.
0x069B14FC=All set?
0x069B2844=Lose!
0x069B284C=Never.
0x069B2864=Ever.
0x069B286C=I wish you would.
0x069B28C8=Ahh, I follow you.
0x069B2938=Sort of. These Games are the only way\nto get inside the Coliseum right now.
0x069B2984=You entering some kind of contest,\nRoxas?
0x069B29B0=Okay, head into the Coliseum.\nJust remember my sure-fire way to\nwin―two words:
0x069B4860=I don't know much about the guy you're\nup against in the finals, but...
0x069B49E4=From the look of him, I'd say he's been\nthrough a few fights.
0x069B4A24=Remember―I'm expectin' stuff from\nyou, kid!
0x069B4A54=Stay sharp!
0x069B4A60=You're doin' great, kid!\nWin the next match, and the title's\nyours!
0x069B4B00=I will.
0x069B4B64=Expecting...\nYou mean you order me to win?
0x069B4B90=It means I have faith you can win.
0x069B4C34=Right.
0x069B4C3C=You've come this far!\nDon't let anybody else walk outta here\nwith your title!
0x069B4CB4=Faith...
0x069B4CC0=Order you?\nWhat are you talkin' about?
0x069B4CE8=Right. Now get out there and knock some\nheads!
0x069B6570=Just dropped in? You could have told\nme you were entering!
0x069B65AC=As if! I just dropped in to see how our\nlittle wannabe hero is doing. I care\nabout your future, Roxas.
0x069B6628=Try to make it look real, Roxas!
0x069B668C=Xigbar!? What are you―\nDon't try and tell me you're a trainee,\ntoo?
0x069B66DC=Hey there, kiddo.
0x069B66F0=Huh!?
0x069B6838=Looks like you're doing pretty well here.
0x069B9F50=Well, Roxas?\nReady to show me all you've learned?
0x069B9F84=Well, well...\nLooks like our target's here.
0x069BA00C=Hey! Forget about the match!\nJust find someplace safe while I go get\nHerc!
0x069BA084=Hey... Is that the―
0x069BA150=Uh-oh... Looks like the finals just got\npostponed!
0x069BEAC8=Demyx! You were here?\nWhy didn't you come and help?
0x069BEBF4=Anyway, I'm beat!\nLet's call it a day.
0x069BEC1C=Besides, the mission's over, right?\nAll's well that ends well, man!
0x069BEC60=I wouldn't read into it too deep.
0x069BECA0=As if!\nThat was a compliment.
0x069BECC0=Yeah, I remember what you said, but the\nguy I scouted wasn't named Roxas.
0x069BED18=Good learner, shows a lot of promise?\nRing any bells?
0x069BEDD0=Nice work out there, man!
0x069BEDEC=What's up with that... I can't imagine he\nwas here on a mission.
0x069BEE30=Who have I been training!?
0x069BEE70=Roxas? Who's that?
0x069BEE9C=What? But...then...
0x069BEEB0=You never can tell what that guy is\nthinking...
0x069BEEEC=Are you blind!?\nThat wasn't part of the Games!
0x069BEF1C=Are you making fun of me?
0x069BEF38=Hurry, Herc!\nYa gotta take out the Heartless that\ncrashed the... Huh?
0x069BEF80=No way, man!
0x069BEFF8=Who was...
0x069BF0E8=Mission accomplie.
0x069BF13C=I'll see you back home.
0x069BF154=Uh...what Heartless, Phil?
0x069BF1C4=Maybe he just wanted an excuse to fight\nme... To test me.
0x069BF200=Right!? And what a shocker to find out\nXigbar was the other finalist!
0x069BF2B0=I...guess so, but...
0x069BF384=And where's Roxas?
0x069BF478=I was, uh...cheering you on!\nCouldn't you hear me? Gimme an “R”!\nGimme an―
0x069BF540=Huh?
0x069BF56C=Not bad!\nOur little Roxas is growing up so fast.
0x069BF5A0=And he said it would take him a while to\nget here. He's probably still on his way.
0x069BF5F4=The new trainee you scouted!\nI been talkin' about him for days now.
0x069BF638=Mission complete.
0x069BF67C=Yeah...
0x069BF6D8=Where'd it go?
0x069C0608=Sounds more like exercise than anything\nelse.
0x069C065C=So today they want me to enter the\nGames and take out Heartless?
0x069C06A0=Well, the sooner I get it done, the\nsooner I can go find Xion.
0x069C303C=Oh yeah?\nWhat good news?
0x069C3058=Well, if you'd have just liste―
0x069C3150=Forget it―doesn't matter.\nLet me get to the good news!
0x069C318C=Well, I figured you musta pulled through.\nNo lousy Heartless is gonna wipe the\nfloor with one of my boys.
0x069C3268=You do!?
0x069C3274=Okay, let's start over, Roxas.\nWhere ya really from? Who sent ya?
0x069C32B8=This whole time I thought you were the\nChamp's top pick!
0x069C32F8=Am I seein' things!?\nRookie, is that you?
0x069C3378=But―you sure you don't mind?
0x069C345C=I'm hanging in there.
0x069C350C=Say no more.\nI get the picture.
0x069C352C=Sure, everybody's got a thing or two\nthey wanna keep hush-hush.
0x069C356C=The Games are bein' held again today.\nYou got perfect timing, kid.\nYou want in?
0x069C360C=This time you might even walk home with\nthe title.
0x069C36C0=Huh? Oh, uh...hey.
0x069C36D4=I haven't seen you in ages.\nHow are ya?
0x069C36FC=That's good. 'Cause that vanishing act\nyou pulled at the end of the last Games\nhad me worried.
0x069C375C=Umm...well...
0x069C37A4=I, uh... Hmm.
0x069C37B4=Speakin' of which, when were ya\nplannin' to tell me you weren't the guy\nHerc sent?
0x069C3808=Just gimme a holler when you're all set.
0x069C38C0=Hmm... I wonder how I'm gonna get\nsigned up.
0x069C38F0=Sorry...
0x069C396C=Sure I'm sure!
0x069C4444=You ready to head in there?
0x069C5E2C=Good. Now, I gotta head back inside to\nget ready for the next match, but, uh...
0x069C5E7C=Hunh, weird.\nWell, the mission's done.
0x069C5EB0=You musta been stickin' to your training\nwhile you were gone. Trust me, kid, it\nshows.
0x069C5F18=Don't be a stranger.
0x069C5F38=Yeah?
0x069C5F8C=I will.
0x069C6004=Nothin', nothin'.
0x069C6068=Well, all right then...\nI'm gonna go.
0x069C6128=Attaboy, Roxas!\nThat's what I like to see!
0x069C61D0=Keep up those workouts, and you're\ngonna get a lot stronger.
0x069C6210=Time to go grab Axel and see if we can\nfind Xion.
0x069C625C=Hey, Roxas...
0x069C6288=What, he wants me to come back?\nFor what? More training?
0x069C6310=What?
0x069C83B0=All right, let's get started.\nYou ready?
0x069C8468=Uhh...
0x069C84B8=Euh...
0x069C84C0=Every second counts.\nI'll be waitin' for ya right here.
0x069C855C=(Hmm, I'm not finished with my recon.)
0x069C8588=What? You forget to tie your sandals?\nGet a move on!
0x069C9298=I got some errands to run, nymphs to\nchase, you know how it is.
0x069C9324=Sorry, kid, but I can't stick around\nanymore today.
0x069C9368=I guess that's it for now, then.\nI'll just have to RTC.
0x069D5F0C=First I should track down Xigbar.\nHe's already in the field.
0x069D6004=Today I'm supposed to take out some\nkind of giant Heartless...
0x069D7A14=So much for just strolling through...
0x069DF22C=Well, well.\nLook who decided to drop in.
0x069DF270=Kiddo, the only thing you'll ever save\nme from is boredom. Let's get this over\nwith, huh?
0x069DF314=Ha ha, Saïx has got some sense of\nhumor if he's sending you to bail me out.
0x069DF364=Huh?
0x069DF3C4=Oh, yeah, this is fair.
0x069DF3E4=Hey, Roxas.\nTaking in the sights?
0x069DF53C=What's so funny about that?
0x069DF5A0=Xigbar!
0x069DF630=You're here to―\nAh ha ha! As if!
0x069DF674=Don't be ridiculous.\nI'm here to back you up!
0x069E16A8=Icecube
0x069E2E8C=That looks giant enough to me.\nC'mon!
0x069E2F0C=Heh heh... Right.\nJust keep your head on straight.
0x069E42B4=Now see?\nThis is more like what I'd call a giant.
0x069E42E8=What...
0x069E436C=Huh?\nOh, come on, quit playing ar―
0x069E43AC=Mission accomplie.
0x069E43D8=Or is it?
0x069E4424=Oh...
0x069E442C=Whoa!
0x069E4468=Mission accomplished.
0x069E55DC=Okay.
0x069E5658=You could have just told me that ice\ncube Heartless wasn't our target.
0x069E5750=Well, yeah, but...
0x069E5774=And for the record, I did warn you to\nkeep your head on straight.
0x069E57B8=There. Now you can say, “Mission\naccomplished.”
0x069E5810=Heh heh.\nCome on, kiddo. Let's RTC.
0x069E5880=But because I didn't, you learned a hard\nand valuable lesson.
0x069E77A0=Hmm...\nThere must be something.
0x069E77E8=No... It's still missing something!
0x069E780C=I want this Halloween to be a festival\nof fantastical frights!
0x069E7884=Something new.\nSomething fresh...
0x069EA15C=They ran off...\nWhat was that all about?
0x069EA188=I should get back...
0x069EA258=Trick or treat!
0x069EA268=Ah ha ha ha!\nWe got you!
0x069EA288=Eureka!
0x069EA290=Huh!?
0x069EA2E0=Something fresh... Something trembling\nwith terror, erupting with excitement!\nHmm...
0x069EA338=What was that? A swirl of sinister\nsmoke, there one minute, then gone...\nThat's never been here before.
0x069EA410=Mmm?
0x069EA418=Waugh!
0x069EA4FC=Something unfamiliar popping up in a\nfamiliar place... Popping...
0x069EBDF4=If we see him again...
0x069EBE20=He'll get another trick!
0x069EBE4C=That was fun!
0x069EBE5C=Wonder who it was.
0x069EBE9C=Don't know! Don't care!
0x069EBEB4=Huh? What's this thing?\nHey! Come see!
0x069ED954=They're in for quite a surprise.
0x069ED994=Oh! I'm almost late!\nI better hurry to the lab.
0x069EDB90=That should do it!\nWhat do you think, Zero?\nI had the Doctor build it for me.
0x069EDBEC=Be a good boy, Zero.
0x069EDC10=On Halloween, I'll light these lanterns\nand make my grand entrance!
0x069EF308=That's weird...
0x069EF370=This wasn't here last time.
0x069EF3AC=And what's that thing?
0x069EF3E0=Where did all the Heartless go?\nI should've seen some by now.
0x069F0EF0=Be sure to tell me about any more\n“ideas” you have, Jack.
0x069F0FA4=Hmm...
0x069F0FAC=I will, Doctor!
0x069F0FBC=These balloons contain a terrifying\ntrick! Anyone who touches them is in\nfor quite a shock!
0x069F108C=I see, I see! Interesting...
0x069F10D4=Terrifying trick?\nIs there something inside?
0x069F117C=Hmm... It's not enough, though.\nMy perfectly petrifying Halloween is\nstill missing something...
0x069F120C=Well, Doctor? What do you think!?\nI've put a few new “ideas” in place for\nthis coming Halloween.
0x069F4074=So that floating doggy thing can sniff\nout Heartless?
0x069F40AC=This new idea is really going to wow\nhim!
0x069F41BC=I'm going to run over to\nDr. Finkelstein's lab right now!
0x069F41F8=Maybe if I give it a bone, it'll help me\ntrack them down.
0x069F4234=What could it be...\nWhat's missing?
0x069F429C=Is there something special about that\nballoon?
0x069F4310=What is it, Zero?\nI'm busy brainstorming...
0x069F43A4=Aha! Someone else must have decided\nto add a new level of terror by hiding a\nHeartless inside!
0x069F44A0=You were trying to give me a hint,\nweren't you, Zero? What a good boy!
0x069F4514=Wait! I've got it!
0x069F4528=Well, that was unexpected!\nA Heartless popped out.
0x069F4604=I'd better keep brainstorming, or\nthey'll think of all the good ideas\nfirst...
0x069F4668=How strange. I certainly didn't put\nanything like that inside.
0x069F4788=You deserve a treat.
0x069F61F4=Catch!
0x069F6210=Huh?
0x069F6284=What's their problem?
0x069F629C=Where to?
0x069F6300=Found ya!
0x069F6328=Run away!
0x069F6398=Waugh!
0x069F63C0=Ahhh ha ha ha ha!\nGot you again!
0x069F6404=Our secret hiding spot!
0x069F641C=What in the world...\nThose are the same kids that messed\nwith me before.
0x069F929C=Catch!
0x069F92F8=Wha―? Who's there!?
0x069F938C=Road block!
0x069F9398=Stop!
0x069F945C=Waugh!
0x069F9484=You can't go past here!
0x069F94DC=Rrgh...\nStop getting in my way!
0x069F94FC=Ah! It's you kids again!
0x069FDA7C=Pranks are the best!
0x069FDA94=N-nothing!
0x069FDAC4=The what? What's back there?
0x069FDBB8=Those three...\nUp to no good again, I'm sure.\n...Wait a minute.
0x069FDBF8=Where to?
0x069FDC10=Hmmm... I like the lantern idea well\nenough, but...
0x069FDC44=Take it easy!
0x069FDD18=Okay, okay! We give up!
0x069FDD68=See for yourself!
0x069FDD9C=Now's our chance!
0x069FDDF8=Our secret hiding spot!
0x069FDE60=That'll be perfect!
0x069FDE74=Yeah, a whole lot of it!
0x069FDE9C=We promise we won't pull any more\npranks! Please let us go, pleeease!
0x069FDEE4=Well, it is!
0x069FDF14=Because it's fun!
0x069FDF28=Pranks?\nGetting in my way was a prank?\nWhy even bother?
0x069FDF60=Tell me why you're blocking the way.
0x069FDFDC=Fun? I don't really see how it's―
0x069FE000=I wish there were something else to add\na little more oomph!
0x069FE040=If we didn't, you'd go back there and\nsee the―er, nothing.
0x069FE080=Run away!
0x069FE08C=Something with oomph...\nExplosions?
0x069FE0C8=Waugh!
0x069FE194=Run awaaay!
0x06A005AC=Our secret hiding spot!
0x06A005FC=Rrgh... Those kids are getting to be a\nreal pain.
0x06A00630=Ahh ha ha ha ha!\nGot you again!
0x06A0065C=And what's this about a secret hiding\nspot? What are they hiding?
0x06A00768=Where to?
0x06A007C8=I should make this quick and get back\nhome.
0x06A007F4=Run away!
0x06A00820=Waugh!
0x06A0228C=Bah, she must have imagined it.\nShe's always been a worrywart.
0x06A022CC=I've been drawing a lot of inspiration\nfrom the world around me!
0x06A02310=Now, as you've been exploring, have\nyou seen Oogie's three rugrats?
0x06A0235C=Ahh, Jack. I've completed the items you\nasked me for. Right over here.
0x06A02554=Not a clue...
0x06A02648=I hear they're up to something on the\noutskirts of town. Any idea what it is\nthis time?
0x06A026A0=Sally said she spotted them the other\nday...
0x06A026D0=Thank you, Doctor! This Halloween will\ntruly be one to remember!
0x06A02714=Very good. Keeping a keen eye trained\non your surroundings is critical for an\ninventor.
0x06A027BC=No doubt...\nYou really are in fine form this year.
0x06A03138=That takes care of that mission. \nTime to RTC.
0x06A04768=Whoa!
0x06A052D4=Hmm, I'd better tell Saïx about this.
0x06A052FC=What was that!?
0x06A064BC=Huh?\nWhere'd all those weird balloons go?
0x06A08388=No balloons here either.\nOr Heartless...
0x06A08440=Whoa!\nThat's...that thing from before!
0x06A0847C=A Heartless!
0x06A0848C=There's gotta be some explanation...
0x06A08530=What!?\nIt...eats Heartless?
0x06A0935C=I guess that explains the drop in the\nHeartless population...
0x06A09470=What ARE those things?\nWhat kind of creature feeds on\nHeartless?
0x06A09538=Maybe I should see what's happening\noutside of town.
0x06A0B5AC=How was I supposed to know it would\ngrow!?
0x06A0B5D8=What are they running from?
0x06A0B60C=Run awaaay!
0x06A0B6E4=Well... One thing at a time.
0x06A0B778=I told you not to pick that thing up!
0x06A0C3D4=Time to find out what's back there.
0x06A0D468=Hello!
0x06A0ED80=A black coat...\nDark, creepy tentacles...
0x06A0EDAC=Mission accomplished.\nTime to RTC.
0x06A0EDDC=Yes, yes, yes! I've got it!
0x06A10F10=There, it's perfect!\nWouldn't you say, Doctor?
0x06A10F84=Stealthy and clever, it appears out of\nnowhere with spooky black tendrils\ngrowing out of its hands!
0x06A10FF4=Under its cloak, it conceals a countless\nbattery of bombs!
0x06A11048=Hmm, yes, it is quite something...
0x06A1106C=Wait a second...
0x06A110B0=Hmm...
0x06A110B8=Yes! The idea occurred to me just\nmoments ago.
0x06A110F0=A fiend like this is guaranteed to plunge\neveryone into the very depths of fear!
0x06A11144=Fascinating. And you plan to make this\nthe centerpiece of next Halloween?
0x06A11190=I'm glad you like it. I can't wait to get\nbusy building more of them!
0x06A111D8=I'm really not seeing it.
0x06A11258=Is this thing supposed to be...me?
0x06A11334=A harbinger of terror and torment!
0x06A113C4=Well, you have my full support.\nQuite a novel idea you've come up with\nthis time, Jack.
0x06A137A4=Wha―?
0x06A137AC=Again!?\nUgh... They haven't changed a bit.
0x06A13818=Trick or treat!
0x06A13828=Ah ha ha ha!\nWe got you!
0x06A138D4=Waugh!
0x06A17260=You can't go past here!
0x06A1D42C=So this is Never Land...
0x06A1D494=It's gotta be around here somewhere.
0x06A1D4BC=What was that Heartless I'm looking\nfor called again? A Wavecrest?
0x06A2125C=There's no mistaking it this time!\nThe treasure's most certainly here!
0x06A2132C=Ha ha! Show me what manner of\ntreasure we've found!
0x06A21418=Aye, aye, Captain Hook!
0x06A21430=Blast!\nAnother dead end!
0x06A2144C=Confound it... If we don't find the right\none soon, someone else could walk off\nwith me treasure.
0x06A2152C=Enough blabbering, Mr. Smee!\nGet that shovel digging!
0x06A21564=That would be a nice change from the\nlast dozen places, eh, Captain?
0x06A215D4=Faster, Smee!\nPut your back into it!
0x06A215FC=Good. Now's my chance to take out\nthose Heartless.
0x06A21660=(Treasure maps?)
0x06A21674=Aye, aye, sir!
0x06A21750=That gold is mine!\nNobody else can have it! Nobody!
0x06A21870=Heh heh heh... Some poor fool must be\ncursing himself now for losing 'em.
0x06A218BC=Oh!?
0x06A218C4=Yikes! Aye, aye, sir!
0x06A21904=C-Captain, sir?
0x06A21914=Captain!\nCaptain, I've struck something!
0x06A21940=Now, now, don't you worry, Captain.\nWe still got a whole pile of other maps\nto follow.
0x06A219C8=Run, Smee!
0x06A219D4=And with the luck you had finding all\nthose treasure maps at once, we'll be\nrich in no time!
0x06A21A34=Gah!\nMore Heartless!?
0x06A229FC=Something about that guy did seem a\nlittle...off.
0x06A22A44=Hmm...\nIs that their ship?
0x06A22AB4=Was this “treasure” some kind of trap?\nOr did something else cause them to\nshow up?
0x06A22BD8=Junk and more junk...\nSo why'd those Heartless pop up like\nthat?
0x06A2A494=Umm...can I help you?
0x06A2A4AC=But how? It's too far.
0x06A2A4C4=But...was it just that stuff you\nsprinkled on me?
0x06A2A4F8=You...want me to go to that ship?
0x06A2A640=Well...all right...\nI believe you.
0x06A2A670=Set a course, Mr. Smee!
0x06A2A688=Whoa!
0x06A2A69C=Are you...\nAre you saying I can fly?
0x06A2A6F4=I can fly!
0x06A2A700=I feel bad not helping her, but I can't\nrisk being spotted.
0x06A2A750=So, now what?\nShould I go to the ship?
0x06A2A778=To wherever the next map says the\ntreasure is!
0x06A2A7EC=You'll find me that treasure, Smee,\neven if it means digging up every inch\nof this island!
0x06A2A93C=Hey, what is this stuff?\nIt's glowing...
0x06A2A968=I'm not giving up till I've struck gold!
0x06A2A9D8=Y-you want me to jump!?
0x06A2A9F8=The mission comes first.
0x06A2AA8C=Where to, Captain?
0x06A2AB00=No, I'm here to take out that Heartless.
0x06A2AB2C=Um...good-bye.
0x06A2AB3C=Wait...
0x06A2AC10=I can't just sprout wings and fly there.
0x06A2AC3C=I-I did it!
0x06A2C380=But then again, without her I never\nwould've found the target.
0x06A2C3C0=Saïx wouldn't like it if I got mixed up in\nanything unrelated to the mission.
0x06A2C4E0=It's like she knew I would believe her―\nthat I could fly.
0x06A2C51C=It's like...
0x06A2C52C=Maybe I should have gone with her...
0x06A2C564=I wonder why she picked me.
0x06A2C60C=Hmm... She went to that ship all by\nherself. I hope she's okay.
0x06A2C6AC=Funny...\nI almost feel like I've done it before.
0x06A3177C=And the Heartless were in the chest?
0x06A31808=Since we got to talk like this.
0x06A31944=They're taking up too much of me time!
0x06A3196C=Yeah.\nStranger things have happened.
0x06A319BC=Why it...it makes me blood boil!
0x06A319E0=Has it been that long?\nTime sure flies. Speaking of which...\nIsn't this the place?
0x06A31A34=So what, they're digging for buried\ngold?
0x06A31B14=Oh, yeah, this is it!\nHere, just watch!
0x06A31B78=I'll blast these scurvy meddlers into\noblivion! Then maybe I can get back to\nhaving you dig in peace.
0x06A31BE0=Let's start by checking the places they\ndug up. Who knows, maybe we'll find our\ntargets down there taking a nap.
0x06A31C84=If you say so, Captain!
0x06A31CEC=Feels like it's been forever.
0x06A31D38=We need to find that treasure before\nsomeone else does.
0x06A31E84=Well...right now we're just guessing.
0x06A31EBC=Blast it all! Not again!?
0x06A31ED8=Captain!?\nWhere are you going, Captain?
0x06A31F00=I know that voice...
0x06A31FA8=Didn't something seem kind of off to you\nabout the guy in red?
0x06A3203C=Not sure, but they mentioned something\nabout treasure maps last time.
0x06A32084=You dig and dig, and all I get is more\nHeartless.
0x06A320C0=I dunno. I think maybe something else is\ncausing them to show up.
0x06A32104=Look, I'm just saying.\nAll I saw in the hole they dug was a\nwooden chest full of junk.
0x06A3215C=Off? Off how?
0x06A321B8=I guess I must need that sparkly dust\nfor it to work.
0x06A3227C=Since what?
0x06A322D4=Uhh, what are you doing, Roxas?
0x06A322F4=Yeah. For some reason, Heartless\nspring up wherever they dig.
0x06A32334=You got a better explanation?
0x06A32398=Huh... That's so weird.\nI could fly before.
0x06A323C4=Huh?
0x06A32438=I'm not so sure that's it.
0x06A32454=You mean Heartless are hiding in the\nground?
0x06A32484=Back to the ship!
0x06A32498=From the looks of it, all they're digging\nup is trouble.
0x06A324D4=Like?
0x06A324DC=What's their story?
0x06A37AB4=Okay...\nI believe you.
0x06A37AE8=I can fly...\nI can fly!?
0x06A37B24=You can fly.
0x06A37BF0=C'mon, try again.\nBelieve me on this, Axel!
0x06A37C1C=Doesn't it belong to those guys from\nbefore?
0x06A37C4C=Oh, because I didn't follow you to the\nship before...
0x06A37CB8=Look, just give it a try.
0x06A37CD4=Oh! Um...hello...again.
0x06A37D10=Yeeeagh!?\nWhat was that?
0x06A37D98=I think she still wants me to go check\nout that ship.
0x06A37DDC=I can't really describe it.\nOnce she sprinkles you, just think,\n“I can fly,” and boom!
0x06A37E38=It's true!
0x06A37E74=“I can fly,” and boom, huh?
0x06A37E94=See? I told you!
0x06A37EB4=All right...
0x06A37F5C=Here, help me show him.\nCould you give us some more of that\nglowing stuff?
0x06A37FA8=I'm not sure, but we met the last time I\nwas here. I don't think she means any\nharm.
0x06A38000=OK...
0x06A38164=Wh-what?\nAre you mad at me?
0x06A38180=I'm not feeling it, Roxas.
0x06A3819C=Yeah, I already saw your demonstration.
0x06A381F0=What, are they your friends?
0x06A38284=She's the one who helped me fly.
0x06A382C8=Wha―!?
0x06A382EC=Apparently not.\nThen why is it so important we―
0x06A3839C=Hey, Roxas...\nWho have we got here?
0x06A383E0=How are you doing that?
0x06A39330=Aye, aye, sir!
0x06A39340=Fire! Fire at will!\nBlow those Heartless right to Davy\nJones's locker!
0x06A3AE00=We don't know what she's after.\nThe mission comes first. Let's find\nthose Artful Flyers.
0x06A3AE74=No... I think they've just mistaken us\nfor Heartless.
0x06A3AEEC=But she―
0x06A3AEF8=Great...
0x06A3AF04=H-hey...wait up!
0x06A3AF84=Roxas! Are you nuts?\nGet back here.
0x06A3B018=Keep your eyes open. I don't want to\nhave to scrape you off a cannonball.
0x06A3B064=They're attacking us?
0x06A3B114=Oh, all right.
0x06A3B13C=Super...
0x06A3CDEC=Hmm? Oh, your tiny friend?
0x06A3CE08=C'mon, let's RTC.
0x06A3CEE0=We're not getting anywhere near that\nship today.
0x06A3CF1C=Heh, you have to at least give them\npoints for trying.
0x06A3CF78=Yeah.\nMaybe we should have gone with her.
0x06A3CFA4=Yeah... I guess so.
0x06A3D04C=I wonder if she's okay...
0x06A3D078=Cheer up. She looked pretty determined.\nShe'll be fine.
0x06A3D0B0=I don't think we had much choice.
0x06A3D160=Mission accomplished.\nAnd what a strange mission it was.
0x06A3FAA4=There there, now, Miss Bell. Be a good\nlittle pixie for us, won't you?
0x06A3FAF8=There's that ship...
0x06A3FBA4=And all I did was keep blowing her off.
0x06A3FC20=And there's those guys.
0x06A3FC6C=I've finally clipped your pestering little\nwings, eh, Tinker Bell?
0x06A3FCD0=Caught you!
0x06A3FCDC=I can worry about today's mission once\nI know she's safe.
0x06A3FD18=I'm right behind ya, Captain!
0x06A3FD38=Is that her name?\nThey caught her!?
0x06A3FDC8=Smee! We're returning to the ship.
0x06A3FDEC=So what. I'm going.
0x06A3FE00=Tinker Bell?
0x06A3FEB0=Planning to interfere with me treasure\nhunt, were you? Well, change of plans!
0x06A3FF78=Serves you right for buzzing about in\nme business!
0x06A3FFAC=She helped me fly before. 
0x06A3FFD4=I have to help her!
0x06A40030=But...she doesn't really have anything\nto do with the mission.
0x06A40D34=If you say so, sir.
0x06A40D48=Sounds like they're inside.
0x06A40DA0=Set a course, Mr. Smee!\nTake us to the next treasure spot!
0x06A40DE0=Aye, we checked this one the other day.\nIt's worthless!
0x06A40E34=But Captain, are ya sure ya want to\ntear it up like that?
0x06A40F20=A-aye, aye, Captain...
0x06A40F38=Confound this useless map!
0x06A445B0=(Hmm... Everywhere they dug, Heartless\n popped out.)
0x06A44640=Huh? Is there something else?
0x06A44668=You can take care of yourself from\nhere, right? I should get going.
0x06A44758=Hey, could you help me fly again?
0x06A447A0=Be careful those guys don't nab you\nagain, okay?
0x06A447F0=I should really get back to my mission\nnow.
0x06A4481C=(Maybe I'll find more Heartless if I\n check these spots.)
0x06A44868=Just a minute.\nI'll get you out of there.
0x06A448FC=I need to go look at the spot marked on\nthis map.
0x06A449F8=There's a spot marked on this map piece.
0x06A44A24=This must be a piece of that map they\nwere talking about. He really shredded\nit.
0x06A44A7C=I'm glad you're okay.
0x06A44ADC=Thanks.
0x06A44AE4=Um... Sorry, but I don't know what\nyou're trying to tell me.
0x06A44BBC=(And they've been digging based on\n these maps...)
0x06A45D38=Huh?\nNothing...
0x06A45D60=This is one of those wooden chests they\nkeep digging up.
0x06A45DA8=Are they not connected?
0x06A45DC0=Unless it's him. That guy in red.\nMaybe he's connected to the Heartless.
0x06A45F04=But then why do Heartless always\nappear when they dig up the chests?
0x06A45F64=Hmm...
0x06A45FC8=Let's see what kind of Heartless pop up.\nMaybe it's the one I'm after!
0x06A4611C=Only one way to find out.\nLet's see what those two are up to.
0x06A47C90=What!?\nAnother Heartless?
0x06A47DC4=Keep digging, Mr. Smee!
0x06A47E5C=Running, sir!
0x06A47E6C=This one looks formidable.\nRun, Smee!
0x06A47E94=Wh-what do we do, Captain?
0x06A47EB0=Aye, sir.
0x06A49144=That pirate's greed oughta have every Heartless for\nmiles here by now.
0x06A4918C=Whoever it is, they're ruinin' my perfect plan!\nThis calls for a new strategy...
0x06A49280=That's strange... The hole they dug's here, plain as\nday, but not a Heartless in sight.
0x06A49310=I'll give that pirate somethin' he can reeeally be\ngreedy about. Then I'll summon a great big whopper\nof a Heartless!
0x06A49388=Rrrgh...\nSomebody must be goin' around and taking 'em out!
0x06A4A760=Another piece of the map...
0x06A4A81C=What's the matter?
0x06A4A83C=There are probably more still lying\naround, huh?
0x06A4CB1C=I wonder why...
0x06A4CB38=Hmm, doesn't look like I'll be able to\ncross without flying.
0x06A4CC1C=You want me to go over there?
0x06A4CC48=Hey, perfect timing!
0x06A4F6EC=It must be priceless!
0x06A4F728=What!?
0x06A4F738=What? Let me see!
0x06A4F74C=What is it now, Smee?
0x06A4F7B8=Those two are still at it?
0x06A4F868=Good work, Smee!
0x06A4F8A8=The treasure ch-chest, sir! It's...
0x06A4F8F8=C-C-Captain?
0x06A4F908=Well, Mr. Smee? This is the last spot.\nMe treasure MUST be here.
0x06A4F9B8=Oh, the lengths I've gone to find this\ntreasure!
0x06A4FA34=Captain! Captain!\nI found it!
0x06A4FA54=I'll have it uncovered in a jiffy, sir!
0x06A52C88=Huh?\nWhat are YOU doing here?
0x06A52CE4=Listen pal, nobody messes with Pete's\nprivate army and gets away with it―\nincluding you!
0x06A52D4C=As always, Captain!
0x06A52DCC=So, it's you what's been goin' around\ntakin' out my Heartless!
0x06A52E28=Blasted Heartless―still insisting on\ngetting in me way!
0x06A52F1C=Let's see how you like that!
0x06A52FD0=Yikes!
0x06A52FF8=Now my new giant Heartless is gonna\npluck you clean outta the sky!
0x06A53084=You know what to do, Smee.\nRun!
0x06A549F4=A few rounds from the Long Tom will\nshow that monster who―
0x06A54A48=Faster, Smee!
0x06A54AD4=Captain! Look!
0x06A569C0=Aw, cheer up, Captain...\nOur luck will turn around soon enough,\nI know it.
0x06A56A0C=H-how did― Why is―?\nMe ship, it's...it's in tatters!
0x06A577A8=Nngh, dag-nabbit!\nI'll get you for this!
0x06A577D4=Private army, huh? What does he want\nan army of Heartless for?
0x06A5D4E4=Where'd the Heartless go!?
0x06A5D594=Heh heh heh... Those blockheads are actually diggin'!\nMy plan's goin' perfectly!
0x06A5D600=...Muh?
0x06A5D694=That's weird...
0x06A5EF00=Oh! Then one of these maps is sure to\nbe the real one, right?
0x06A5EFA4=Stop whining, Smee, and think!\nWhy were there so many maps?\nI'll tell you why.
0x06A5EFF4=We've done a good bit of digging\nalready, and all we've found is pieces\nof junk and them Heartless creatures...
0x06A5F0F4=The Heartless must have been\nplanted at the marked spots as guard\ndogs.
0x06A5F1EC=Whoever buried the treasure made\nfake maps to lead me astray and\nprotect the real hiding spot!
0x06A5F2BC=Aye, and the only way to know which it is\nis to follow them all!
0x06A5F300=Aye, aye, Captain!
0x06A5F3A0=Well, no one outwits Captain Hook.\nThat treasure is mine―mine, mine, mine!
0x06A5F408=B-but, sir...do you really think it's\nworth the trouble?
0x06A5F4A0=Now, get a move on, Smee!
0x06A60664=Look lively, Mr. Smee!
0x06A606A8=Oh!\nBut what about Tinker Bell?
0x06A60740=Hmph. Let her get acquainted with her\nnew home―that lamp.
0x06A607A0=Okay, the coast is clear.
0x06A6115C=So it was him.\nHe must be what's drawing all these\nHeartless.
0x06A61204=I'm not sure why, but I guess that's a\nquestion for another day.
0x06A6663C=Alrighty then.\nFollow me.
0x06A66658=Heya, Roxas.
0x06A66668=Okay.
0x06A666CC=Not yet.
0x06A667C0=Round...Room...?
0x06A667E4=Wanna head over there now?
0x06A66800=Yup. Apparently the boss man's got\nsome big news.
0x06A66840=Ah, I remember now.\nWe were supposed to convene in the\nRound Room today. Blegh, meetings...
0x06A6691C=Okay, just holler when you're ready.\nNot like you can find it on your own,\nright?
0x06A669B4=Something I can help you with there,\nchatterbox?
0x06A684DC=Think of these early missions as\nexercises. You still have much to learn\nbefore we put you to a real test.
0x06A6856C=Axel will be joining you your first time\nout. Isn't that right, Axel?
0x06A685EC=Oh boy... What, are you making me the\nkid's mentor now?
0x06A686A4=Surely you don't mind showing Roxas\nhere the ropes? Roxas, come see me\nwhen you're ready to go.
0x06A68704=Well, you heard the man.\nStarting today, I'm your babysitter.
0x06A68750=Sheesh... Quit acting like a zombie,\nand let's get this show on the road.
0x06A687C0=Roxas, your work begins today.\nI will issue missions, which the\nOrganization expects you to carry out.
0x06A6AA58=And our boss's name?
0x06A6AA70=Right. I knew that.
0x06A6AA84=You sure?\nHow 'bout my name, then?
0x06A6AAB4=Don't worry.\nI'll be sure he makes the grade.
0x06A6AB34=Hey, what's wrong?\nYou worried about the new kid?\nWhat was that name again...
0x06A6ABF4=Xemnas.
0x06A6AC04=...Yeah.
0x06A6AC30=Axel...
0x06A6AC9C=It's Axel.
0x06A6ACA8=Xion.
0x06A6AD08=Xemnas...
0x06A6AD70=Got it memorized, Roxas?
0x06A6AD98=Very good, Roxas!\nNo way you're gonna forget his name,\nright? Now, let's get moving.
0x06A6ADF0=Xion...
0x06A6AE2C=C'mon, Roxas.
0x06A6AE50=Number ⅧⅣ, Xion.
0x06A6AE68=Teach him well, Axel.
0x06A6C614=Hmm?
0x06A6C61C=Uh-huh.
0x06A6C654=I'm sorry, speak up?\nCooouldn't quite catch that.
0x06A6C6E0=I said...
0x06A6C6F4=Ha ha!\nI dunno if I want a blindfolded zombie\non the loose.
0x06A6C73C=All right, smart aleck, you did good.\nAnd no successful mission is complete\nwithout a little icing on the cake. C'mon.
0x06A6C804=Bravo. So whaddaya think?\nGot the hang of this mission business?
0x06A6C848=But...don't we have to RTC?
0x06A6C8F4=Later.\nDon't you remember our hangout?
0x06A6C944=I could have done that blindfolded.
0x06A6E814=It's sea-salt ice cream.\nC'mon, I already told you once.\nGet it memorized, man.
0x06A6E8A4=Yeah?
0x06A6E8AC=Maybe.
0x06A6E970=Ha ha. Roxas, you said the same exact\nthing the other day.
0x06A6E9AC=I guess it's a start.
0x06A6E9C4=Well, that's okay.\nToday's where it all really begins\nanyway.
0x06A6EA0C=Here ya go.\nThe icing on the cake.
0x06A6EA48=Hey, what has it been, a week since you\nshowed up?
0x06A6EA7C=It's really salty...but sweet, too.
0x06A6EAA0=Oh...
0x06A6EB24=Sure! Here you are, out in the field,\nworking for the Organization...\nToday, you're one of us.
0x06A6EBEC=Euh...
0x06A6EBF4=I did?\nI don't remember that.
0x06A6EC34=Umm...
0x06A6EC48=“Maybe”?\nC'mon, you must remember that much.
0x06A6ED74=You remember what this ice cream is\ncalled?
0x06A72D2C=Ils étaient bizarres.
0x06A72D84=Hmm...\nMust be some kids who live here.
0x06A72E28=Whaddaya mean, why?
0x06A72E3C=Why?
0x06A72E64=Like those kids we just saw―they were\nfriends.
0x06A73088=Last one there has to buy the winner\nan ice cream!
0x06A730C8=Sort of... That, or laugh at stupid\nstuff that doesn't make any sense.
0x06A73120=Because we're friends.
0x06A73138=C'mon, I'll show you how it works.
0x06A7315C=C'mon, let's get some ice cream.
0x06A731B4=No fair, Hayner!
0x06A7320C=So, got any plans?
0x06A73220=So...friends are people who have ice\ncream together?
0x06A7327C=Yeah?\nHow do you figure?
0x06A73360=Oh, sure, now you tell us!
0x06A7338C=Who were they?
0x06A7339C=Oh... Then I guess they're different\nfrom us.
0x06A733CC=Really?
0x06A73428=Hey, wait up!
0x06A73438=I was just gonna report to Saïx and\nthen go to my room like I always do.
0x06A73484=They sure acted weird.
0x06A73514=Go to your room!?\nOh, Roxas, Roxas...
0x06A73564=You mean laughter?\nSometimes people with hearts do that\neven when it doesn't make any sense.
0x06A735D0=Move it, Pence!
0x06A735E0=Why did those last two seem to enjoy\ngetting pushed around like that? They\nwere even making those “ha ha” noises.
0x06A73658=Better get flyin' if you don't wanna end\nup buyin'!
0x06A75548=Yes it was!\nI saw you drop it!
0x06A7560C=Let's meet up for ice cream again after\nyour next mission.
0x06A7567C=Come on, Hayner!\nYou can go one stinking day without\nice cream!
0x06A756BC=I mean, who wants to spend their days\njust bouncing between work and the\ncastle, right?
0x06A757A4=Hey, I laughed...\nI guess we really are friends.
0x06A757D8=Hey, Roxas.
0x06A75824=Ha ha, not me!
0x06A75858=You owe me an ice cream!\nGet back here, Pence!
0x06A7589C=I swear, Hayner, it wasn't my fault!
0x06A77D18=Cool...
0x06A77D6C=How's work? Goin' okay?
0x06A77D84=That's good.
0x06A77DC8=Yeah, can't complain.
0x06A7A19C=The Organization's got a second castle\nsituated in the world between worlds.
0x06A7A1EC=Well, I gotta head back and get ready.\nFun fun fun... Anyway, you take your\ntime.
0x06A7A25C=It's called Castle Oblivion.\nGot it memorized?
0x06A7A388=I'm gonna miss this ice cream thing we\ndo.
0x06A7A3B4=Oh...
0x06A7A3BC=Since you're my buddy, I guess I can\nfill you in.
0x06A7A3F0=What's that?
0x06A7A528=Yeah.\nI wish people told me these things.
0x06A7A570=Starting tomorrow, I'm gonna be away.
0x06A7A5B8=I'm gonna be at Castle Oblivion for a\nwhile.
0x06A7A66C=Huh? Why?
0x06A7B72C=And I take it that's straight from Lord\nXemnas's lips, huh?
0x06A7B7A4=Find them, and dispose of them.
0x06A7B7C4=We have reason to believe one or more\nof the members assigned to C.O. intend\nto betray us.
0x06A7B868=Axel.\nI have a message from Lord Xemnas.
0x06A7CEC8=But...this ice cream stick that says\nWINNER... I have to ask him what I won.
0x06A7CF30=Axel!
0x06A7CF50=Axel already left.
0x06A7DFD8=Today marks your first time out on a\nmission together.
0x06A7E110=We need you to eliminate a specific\nHeartless. Roxas, you are in charge.
0x06A7E168=Me?\nOh...okay.
0x06A7F000=Let's go.
0x06A7F058=(I'm in charge, huh?)
0x06A80180=I've got someplace to be.\nYou go ahead and RTC without me.
0x06A827BC=Xion, of course.\nWho else, kiddo?
0x06A8280C=My name's not “kiddo.”
0x06A8287C=Bossy coworkers?
0x06A828F8=This place is, like, a hundred times\nbetter minus all the bossy coworkers,\nam I right?
0x06A82964=Ah...
0x06A8296C=Oh...
0x06A82A20=Roxas, get to work.
0x06A82A64=Yeah, the “dream team” that got\nshipped off to Castle Oblivion.\nDreamy for me, because they're gone!
0x06A82ADC=Poppet? Who's that?
0x06A82B18=Too bad you and Poppet didn't get to\nspend more quality time with them.
0x06A83F18=Your name...it's...Roxas, isn't it?
0x06A83F48=R...Roxas...
0x06A83F58=Yeah, Xion.\n...That's right.
0x06A83F7C=Huh?
0x06A83FC8=What did you say?
0x06A8400C=I've got someplace to be again today,\nso go on ahead without me.
0x06A840CC=Rox... as...
0x06A84894=My name... Was that the first thing\nXion's ever said?
0x06A85C44=Something the matter?
0x06A85CA4=Good...morning, Roxas.
0x06A85CE8=Both of you, finish your preparations\nASAP. A giant Heartless has surfaced.\nIt must be exterminated today.
0x06A85E00=Morning, Xion.
0x06A85E28=Euh...
0x06A85E30=Umm...
0x06A871D8=Roxas.
0x06A87210=You too, Xion.
0x06A87278=Good luck today.
0x06A87298=Th-thanks.
0x06A89880=Yeah, the icing on the cake.\nC'mon. There's this place...
0x06A898C4=Yeah...neither did I.
0x06A89948=Something extra?
0x06A89A40=You did great. In fact, you deserve a\nlittle something extra.
0x06A89B30=Whoa! Xion, I didn't know you could use\nthe Keyblade.
0x06A8BCF8=Well?\nGo on, try it.
0x06A8BD10=Exactement.
0x06A8BD38=Heeere ya go.
0x06A8BD48=Sea-salt ice cream.
0x06A8BD5C=When Axel gets back, let's ask him.\nThen all three of us can have ice\ncream together!
0x06A8BE4C=A little something extra?
0x06A8BEEC=Axel's my first friend.
0x06A8BFA4=Okay...
0x06A8BFAC=Sea-salt is Axel's favorite.
0x06A8C008=Exactly.
0x06A8C014=I don't remember it too well, but Axel\nsaid he took me here my very first day\nwith the Organization.
0x06A8C07C=You guys must be close.
0x06A8C094=Your...friend?
0x06A8C0CC=It's sweet.\nBut kinda salty, too.
0x06A8C0F0=Roxas, do you think I could be a friend?
0x06A8C11C=Sounds like it's yours, too!
0x06A8C1BC=It's really good, right?\nMe and Axel always meet up here for\nice cream after work.
0x06A8C264=Heh, yeah.
0x06A8C270=How'd you find such a great place?
0x06A8C30C=Okay!
0x06A8C314=And then he bought me some ice cream\nagain after my first mission. Said it was\nthe “icing on the cake.”
0x06A8CE9C=I hope it's with Xion.
0x06A8CF18=Wonder what today's mission is.
0x06A8EA20=That's no concern of yours.
0x06A8EA48=But...
0x06A8EB0C=Who knows.\nPerhaps he is among the lost.
0x06A8EB4C=Roxas, your mission.\nGo with Xigbar to Agrabah.
0x06A8EB7C=Terminated?\nBut that means...
0x06A8EBA8=But what about Axel?
0x06A8EBD8=Okay? As if. Word has it at least one\nof the folks we sent to Castle Oblivion\nhas been terminated.
0x06A8ECC4=Don't look at me, man!\nI just found out minutes ago.
0x06A8ECFC=No buts. There's work to be done.\nGet yourself ready.
0x06A8ED78=...Then what in blazes did happen?
0x06A8EDF4=Is everything okay?
0x06A8EE20=Is it true about Castle Oblivion?
0x06A92044=As if. We're not even supposed to “be”\nin the first place. What's there to\nleave behind?
0x06A920A4=But the hearts go somewhere:\nKingdom Hearts.
0x06A920E8=They don't go anywhere. They're gone.\nOnly the hearts they held remain.
0x06A92188=Nope.
0x06A921D8=And I'll never see them again?
0x06A921F8=Huh?\nOh...yeah.
0x06A92208=Oh...
0x06A92210=Then whoever it was at Castle\nOblivion―
0x06A9223C=You coming?
0x06A9233C=Hey, where do Heartless go when\nthey're destroyed?
0x06A923C4=Gone.
0x06A92500=Nngh!?\nWhat's going...on...
0x06A9251C=So what if a person without a heart is\ndestroyed―a Nobody like you or me?\nDoes some part of us remain?
0x06A92E78=Who are you?
0x06A94124=Naminé must have begun her work...
0x06A9419C=I am told he will―provided she strips\nthe hero of all his memories.
0x06A94210=And the chamber?\nHave you found it?
0x06A942E4=Xion can fill Roxas's shoes for the time\nbeing.
0x06A94328=We needn't stop collecting hearts.\nNumber ⅧⅣ has gained power over the\nKeyblade, just as we intended.
0x06A943A0=No, sir. I would say progress is slow...\nif we had actually made any.
0x06A943E8=So, sleep has taken you yet again...
0x06A94410=Then much hinges on Castle Oblivion.
0x06A94438=Will he wake from this?
0x06A95138=I went to a new world today.\nRoxas, you should've seen it.
0x06A951A8=It was so beautiful.
0x06A95284=Well, I'll visit you tomorrow, okay?\nBye, Roxas...
0x06A982B4=You were sleeping―a long, long time.
0x06A98354=Hold it up to your ear.
0x06A983C8=Well, you're awake now.\nThat's what counts.
0x06A983F4=Xion...\nWhat happened to me?
0x06A984DC=Saïx told us not to get our hopes up.\nThat you might not―
0x06A9851C=Ugh, I feel like a zombie.\nGuess there's some things a nap can't\ncure.
0x06A98590=Here, I brought you this.
0x06A985D8=Roxas!?
0x06A98608=Tu as dormi longtemps...\ntrès longtemps.
0x06A98668=It's a seashell. I've been picking one up\nevery time I go out on a mission.
0x06A99158=You're awake.
0x06A99188=What I know is that I don't owe you any\nexplanations. Now get to work.
0x06A991E4=Did you ever find out what happened at\nCastle Oblivion?
0x06A992F0=We're looking into what befell them.
0x06A99358=You'll be on your own for a while.\nWherever our other members are,\nthey're certainly not here to help.
0x06A993C0=“Them”!? How many?\nYou still don't know?
0x06A9B51C=Blegh!
0x06A9B524=But I could get used to a smaller, more\ntightly knit group, how 'bout you?
0x06A9B610=Gone with the wind―right, Xiggy?\nWhew, I really dodged a bullet there.
0x06A9B738=Roger that. Remind me to underachieve\ntwice as hard from now on.
0x06A9B7E4=Heh heh, now you get to double your\nhours to help pick up the slack.
0x06A9B82C=Hey, Roxas, man, did you hear?\nNo survivors! Everybody at C.O. got\nK.O.'d! Heavy stuff.
0x06A9B898=You gotta admit, the castle's a lot\nquieter. Half as loud, you might say.
0x06A9B95C=Then they're really gone.
0x06A9B998=Lucky you.
0x06A9B9BC=Nothing, okay?
0x06A9B9CC=Heh heh, here comes sourpuss.\nWhy the long face?
0x06A9D554=What's the matter?\nYou look like you've seen a ghost.
0x06A9D58C=You had me worried.
0x06A9D5BC=How's it hanging?
0x06A9D66C=But...I thought you were gone!\nCastle Oblivion―the whole team was\nannihilated...
0x06A9D6C0=Correction: the weaklings were\nannihilated.
0x06A9D6EC=Hey, Roxas!
0x06A9D6F8=W-wait here.\nI'll go buy us some ice cream!
0x06A9D838=Worried? Well, that's a neat trick,\nconsidering you haven't got a heart to\nfeel with.
0x06A9D8A8=Axel?
0x06A9EF8C=Thanks.
0x06A9EFB0=Yeah. I promised her the three of us\ncould have ice cream together―you\nknow, once you got back.
0x06A9F014=You haven't RTC'd yet?
0x06A9F034=Guess I needed some time to sort out\nmy feelings.
0x06A9F068=Hey, your ice cream's melting.\nEat up.
0x06A9F090=Me and her are friends now.
0x06A9F138=Whatever, mister I-don't-have-a-\nheart.
0x06A9F16C=Hmm? Nah.
0x06A9F184=Xion? Really?
0x06A9F1AC=Well, why come here?
0x06A9F2B0=You know, I started inviting Xion up\nhere while you were gone.
0x06A9F314=I gotta check in with the boss, or he's\ngonna let me have it.
0x06AA0D44=Come on, I would have told you that\nmuch.
0x06AA0D70=Well, it's nice to know where I stand!\nSheesh...
0x06AA0DA4=You searched every room, I expect?
0x06AA0DD4=I gotta hand it to you...
0x06AA0DF0=What about the chamber?\nDid you find it?
0x06AA0E84=I'm told Naminé has gone missing.
0x06AA0EE0=That's how you wanted it, right?\nI'll play it your way...for now.
0x06AA0F24=You were right.\nAbout Marluxia, the traitors...\nYou knew exactly what was up.
0x06AA0F74=You're kidding, right?
0x06AA1010=All I did was find a place to send\neveryone who was getting in the way.
0x06AA11E8=Did you come back in one piece or didn't\nyou?
0x06AA1218=I disposed of Zexion.
0x06AA1230=Oh, good to see you, too.\nYou're welcome, thanks for the kind\nwords.
0x06AA12B8=Why didn't you report in?
0x06AA12F8=That's like counting grains of dust in\na building full of sneezing people.
0x06AA1380=There one minute, gone the next.\nI don't know how she got out.
0x06AA233C=Hey, get this: they paired me with you\ntoday as a “slap on the wrist.”
0x06AA23C4=Oh, thanks!
0x06AA2448=Pfft.\nAll right, c'mon, partner.
0x06AA246C=What?\nWhy am I a slap on the wrist!?
0x06AA2494=Would it kill them to give me a day off?\nLook at these bags under my eyes.
0x06AA24EC=Right behind ya.
0x06AA2544=Well, they just know how much I loathe\nbabysitting...
0x06AA322C=Yup.
0x06AA3278=That takes care of that.\nReady to go?
0x06AA43A4=Yeah? Well you are, too.
0x06AA43E0=Heh. Let's just say you can thank\nyourself that we get to sit here again\nand laugh like idiots over ice cream.
0x06AA446C=Me? You think?\nGuess he musta rubbed off on me...
0x06AA44D4=You're more outgoing now, you know\nthat?
0x06AA454C=Huh? Who did?
0x06AA455C=I guess Xion's not gonna show today.
0x06AA5BD0=Xion? Hmm...
0x06AA5BF8=The two of you are friends, right?\nTell ya what. I'll pick Saïx's brain, see\nwhat I can find out.
0x06AA5C5C=Wish I could help, but I took off for\nC.O. almost as soon as Xion joined up.\nThere's a lot I missed.
0x06AA5D48=I feel bad. I promised we'd all get\ntogether for some ice cream.
0x06AA5D8C=It's been days now...\nTen days, at least.
0x06AA5DB8=Now that you mention it, no.
0x06AA5E00=Where is she?
0x06AA5E48=Axel. You seen Number ⅧⅣ?
0x06AA5E74=Hey, Roxas.
0x06AA5E80=Thanks, Axel.
0x06AA8854=I found out about love on today's\nmission―that it's something powerful.
0x06AA8920=Right...
0x06AA8978=Axel, I need to ask you something.
0x06AA89A8=Once Kingdom Hearts is complete, you'll\nbe able to do all kinds of things.
0x06AA8A40=I don't get it.
0x06AA8ABC=Somebody's gotta talk to that girl.
0x06AA8AF4=That's true. It is.\nBut I'll never get to experience it.
0x06AA8B30=What's up?
0x06AA8B3C=You mean, like, if they're best friends?
0x06AA8B68=You need a heart, man.
0x06AA8B8C=Ah...
0x06AA8B94=Hey, here comes the hard worker.
0x06AA8BB8=Oh...
0x06AA8BF0=Xion around?
0x06AA8C88=Did something happen?
0x06AA8CB4=Yes... Well, no.\nThere aren't “steps.”
0x06AA8CE8=It's her choice if she wants to come\njoin us or not.
0x06AA8D20=Nah, it's just...\nThis is gonna sound stupid.
0x06AA8D74=What does it matter?\nWe'll never know the difference.
0x06AA8DB8='Scuse me?
0x06AA8DC4=Love is what happens if there's\nsomething really special between two\npeople.
0x06AA8E8C=That's good.
0x06AA8EBC=Do you know what love is?
0x06AA8ED8=Haven't seen her.
0x06AA8EEC=If I had a heart, you think I could love\nsomebody?
0x06AA8F38=So then...love is like a step above\nfriends?
0x06AA8FE4=Well, you can care about your friends,\nI guess, but that's not what I'm talking\nabout.
0x06AA91B8=I guess that's fair.
0x06AA91D0=Nobodies can't love?
0x06AA9D40=I hope Xion's okay...
0x06AA9D98=Where's Axel?
0x06AAB6DC=I asked Saïx about Xion.
0x06AAB758=I dunno. But we'll find out what\nhappened soon enough.
0x06AAB790=Rise and shine, sleepyhead.
0x06AAB7F4=Why's that?
0x06AAB800=You and me get to go track Xion down.\nThat's our mission today.
0x06AAB850=And?
0x06AAB894=No, I made it all up.\nGo back to bed.
0x06AAB8BC=Sorry... I was up late.\nCouldn't sleep.
0x06AAB8E4=You mean it!?
0x06AAB8F4=Your friend was sent out on a mission,\nbut never RTC'd.
0x06AAB9D8=But...why not?\nShouldn't the mission be done by now?
0x06AABA70=...Yes, I mean it!\nHurry up and get ready, will ya?
0x06AAE218=Focus, Roxas!\nWe have to take that thing out first!
0x06AAE288=Xion!
0x06AAE2F0=Roxas!?
0x06AAF5F0=I'm fine... Thanks.\nIt's just...
0x06AAF628=Nngh...\nR...Roxas?
0x06AAF66C=That looked like it hurt.
0x06AAF698=Xion!\nAre you okay?
0x06AAF6AC=You can tell us all about it―but first,\nlet's find a place to sit down.
0x06AB5378=You don't mind?
0x06AB5388=Ah ah ah, BUT...Roxas, that also means\nyou have to collect twice as many\nhearts.
0x06AB5478=We're here for you if you want to get\nit off your chest. Right, Roxas?
0x06AB552C=But...it's just like Xion said.\nNo Keyblade, no can do.
0x06AB55B8=What if you worked double duty, Roxas?
0x06AB5644=Then, he can collect the hearts...
0x06AB567C=I can do it.
0x06AB568C=They're gonna turn me into a Dusk once\nthey find out they don't need me.
0x06AB578C=I swat them in one place and they just\npop up in another.
0x06AB5814=Thanks.
0x06AB5880=Is there anything you can do, Axel?
0x06AB58F8=Thank you...\nRoxas, Axel, thank you!
0x06AB5920=Thanks...
0x06AB592C=What do you mean, Axel?
0x06AB5944=What's wrong?\nNot hungry?
0x06AB59E0=Hey, I'm racking my brain here, and\nthere's just no way to―
0x06AB5A74=Without the Keyblade...I'm useless.
0x06AB5B20=I'm supposed to be collecting hearts.\nThose are my orders.
0x06AB5B88=Axel, that's brilliant!
0x06AB5BA0=Eat up. It's gonna melt.
0x06AB5BEC=I can't...\nI can't use the Keyblade anymore.
0x06AB5C1C=I know.
0x06AB5C38=You wanna talk about what happened?
0x06AB5C74=I don't know. But if I don't defeat\nHeartless with the Keyblade...
0x06AB5CB8=What? Tell us.
0x06AB5CC8=Yeah.\nThat's what friends are for.
0x06AB5D84=C'mon, Axel, think of something!
0x06AB5DA8=Huh?
0x06AB5DD4=There ya go.
0x06AB5DF0=...and nobody will ever have to know\nthat you're not doing the same.
0x06AB5E38=And without it, I can't do my job.
0x06AB5E5C=What happened?
0x06AB5E6C=Eat your ice cream.
0x06AB5EB0=Xion, stick with Roxas until you can\ncontrol the Keyblade again. Make sure\nyour missions are with him.
0x06AB5F24=...the hearts they release just find\ntheir way into other Heartless instead.
0x06AB5F98=Hey, friends have gotta be able to lean\non each other now and then. Ain't that\nright, Roxas?
0x06AB6010=Wait.
0x06AB60BC=So...Axel, does that mean you and I can\nbe friends?
0x06AB60F0=Wish there was.
0x06AB615C=But―
0x06AB6164=Of course not!
0x06AB6174=Well, yeah. Was there ever any doubt?\nAny friend of Roxas's is a friend of\nmine.
0x06AB7380=Hey.
0x06AB7388=Morning, Roxas.
0x06AB7434=Yeah, c'mon.
0x06AB7444=You ready to give this a shot?
0x06AB8E80=If you let us pair up, we can do tougher\nmissions for you, no problem.
0x06AB8F2C=Why not? Seems like a good idea to me.\nPut two half-pints together and you\nget a whole.
0x06AB8F9C=What in the world would possess you to\nask at a time like this?
0x06AB8FF4=Fine. As you wish.
0x06AB90B8=Hmm...
0x06AB90C0=We're shorthanded as it is.\nAnd yet you expect me to say yes?
0x06AB9180=Yeah, is it a problem?
0x06AB920C=Together?
0x06ABC104=Hey, mission go okay?
0x06ABC150=Sure, if you feel really close to each\nother. If you're best friends.
0x06ABC198=That's right.\nPeople need their space.
0x06ABC1C0=Couldn't tell ya.\nI don't have one.
0x06ABC1E4=We try.
0x06ABC24C=So where'd they end up sending you?
0x06ABC270=Well, I think you can be inseparable\neven if you're apart.
0x06ABC2AC=Agrabah.
0x06ABC2D4=That place you and me went before...\nUhh, what was it again...
0x06ABC31C=But, I guess you can't always jump in\nand do everything for your friends―\neven if you want to.
0x06ABC3A8=Ah...
0x06ABC46C=Oh...
0x06ABC48C=Yeah, I think it's gonna work...\nThanks, Axel. You and Roxas are the\nbest.
0x06ABC588=Genie sounded really worried about his\nfriend―some guy named Al.
0x06ABC66C=Yeah, it's not like they were joined at\nthe hip.
0x06ABC740=Really?
0x06ABC748=So then, why did Genie say he and Al\nwere “inseparable”?
0x06ABC788=We sure ran into some interesting\ncharacters this time, huh?
0x06ABC7C8=Oh, that city in the desert.
0x06ABC7FC=What's it like having a best friend,\nAxel?
0x06ABC828=You mean Pete and Genie?
0x06ABDE88=Lord Xemnas has summoned us.
0x06AC01BC=Look to the skies!
0x06AC01D0=Remember why we have organized―\nall the things we hope to achieve.
0x06AC02B8=See the countless hearts that have\ngathered? Hearts full of rage...hate...\nsadness...and bliss.
0x06AC0420=My friends!
0x06AC0480=The time has arrived.
0x06AC0498=There, in the sky, hangs the promise of\na new world.
0x06AC0568=Never again will it...have power over\nus.
0x06AC05B4=The strength of the human heart is\nvast. Soon, though...we will have\ngained power over it!
0x06AC0760=There hangs the heart of all hearts―\nKingdom Hearts―shining down on us at\nlast.
0x06AC326C=Sure you do.\nWe have to finish Kingdom Hearts.
0x06AC329C=It's where all the hearts you and I\ncollect wind up.
0x06AC331C=Are you crazy?
0x06AC332C=Well, great. Keep it up.
0x06AC34DC=Hey, you two. How'd work go?\nThink you can keep pulling off double\nduty?
0x06AC3564=Roxas... We're fighting because we\nwant to know what it's about.
0x06AC35F8=Roxas took today's Heartless out in no\ntime flat.
0x06AC3660=But don't you ever stop and wonder?\nWe're fighting for something we don't\nknow anything about.
0x06AC36C0=Exactly. It's because of you two and\nthe Keyblade that we're finally making\nsome progress.
0x06AC3788=We finally got our first glimpse of it\ntoday, remember?
0x06AC37C0=Yeah, but what do we need with it?
0x06AC37FC=So far so good.
0x06AC3968=“The strength of the human heart is\n vast,” Xemnas said.
0x06AC39A8=I don't know why we need to continue\nfighting Heartless like this.
0x06AC39EC=I just don't understand why having a\nheart is so important. Do you?
0x06AC3A30=Kind of a strange time to bring it up...
0x06AC3AA0=We might finally get hearts of our own.
0x06AC3AC8=Yeah, but what is it?\n“The heart of all hearts”?
0x06AC3B90=Yeah...\nYeah, I guess you're right.
0x06AC4A80=C'mon, Axel's waiting.
0x06AC4AA4=Okay.
0x06AC8928=Me? Oh, I dunno.\nSame guy, more or less.
0x06AC8954=Well, maybe Saïx and Xigbar are tough\nto fool, but come on―Demyx?
0x06AC899C=Don't be too sure.\nThey're not stupid.
0x06AC8A14=That's one of the things that makes the\nOrganization members special.
0x06AC8A5C=But look at him! All he does is play his\nsitar all the time.
0x06AC8A9C=Of course!\nWhere'd they send you, Axel?
0x06AC8AC4=Hey, for all you know, he's out there\nfighting Heartless and doing recon―\njust the same as you.
0x06AC8B3C=Ouch! Roxas, that's not cool.
0x06AC8B74=But I can't remember anything―\nnot even my first week as a Nobody.
0x06AC8C4C=Heart collection in Agrabah.\nSame as usual.
0x06AC8CC8=What past?
0x06AC8CD4=Guess we'll just have to cross our\nfingers.
0x06AC8D08=I guess everybody in the Organization\nis good at different things.
0x06AC8D4C=Oh, I think we have other things that\nset us apart.
0x06AC8D80=Okay, no he doesn't.\nBut I'm pretty sure he has a job.
0x06AC8DD4=You remember stuff from before?
0x06AC8DF4=You two do have a lot in common.
0x06AC8EBC=I don't think you give him enough credit.\nHe works just as hard as―
0x06AC8F04=I don't.
0x06AC8F10=Me neither.
0x06AC9054=Relax, we'll be fine.
0x06AC906C=Unlike lesser Nobodies, we remember\nwho we were.
0x06AC90A0=You know, I've seen Demyx out in the\nfield, rocking out on that sitar of his.
0x06AC90F0=You mean the castle with the talking\ncandelabra?
0x06AC9184=That's the one. They needed me to do a\nlittle digging through the dust and\ncobwebs. How 'bout you?
0x06AC91E8=Trust me, you're not missing much.\nWho needs baggage, right?
0x06AC9228=Well...maybe that right there is what\nmakes YOU unique.
0x06AC92AC=What kind of person were you like\nbefore you were a Nobody?
0x06AC9368=But I've heard him say he wasn't cut\nout for combat.
0x06AC943C=Oh, thanks!
0x06AC9528=Even Nobodies?\nDon't you need a heart to be unique?
0x06AC959C=Lucky.\nI wish I could remember.
0x06AC95F4=I'm like you, Roxas. I don't remember\nmuch from the beginning either.
0x06AC963C=Man, whatever.\nYou have trouble remembering things\nfrom five seconds ago.
0x06AC96DC=That's right.\nEverybody's unique.
0x06AC9748=The place you guys hit yesterday.
0x06AC976C=Another successful day?
0x06AC9784=I don't know how much longer we can\nfool the other members, though.
0x06AC97C8=I wonder what kind of guy I was\nbefore...
0x06AC983C=You're really getting the hang of\nworking together, huh?
0x06AC98B4=Like our pasts.
0x06AC9910=What does that accomplish?
0x06ACCF14=Except you can't collect hearts.
0x06ACCFBC=Is that okay with you, Saïx?
0x06ACD024=I was just there yesterday for recon,\nremember? I saw the Heartless you're\ntalking about.
0x06ACD080=If I send them both, who's going to\nhandle the Heartless in Agrabah?
0x06ACD114=Two major Heartless targets have\nsurfaced in two separate worlds.
0x06ACD158=Xion, Roxas.\nI need you on separate missions today.
0x06ACD23C=Morning, Xion.
0x06ACD24C=Sure, I'm a big boy.
0x06ACD264=You ready for another day?
0x06ACD280=You?
0x06ACD2E4=So what?\nI'll keep the Heartless out of trouble,\nthen they can hit it another day.
0x06ACD344=Fine. But this is the last day.\nStarting tomorrow, you both work solo.
0x06ACD3FC=Whoa, you're gonna send Roxas to\nBeast's Castle? I dunno...
0x06ACD444=But how can―\nNever mind.
0x06ACD4BC=What? Why?
0x06ACD508=I will.
0x06ACD564=Hey, Roxas.
0x06ACD570=Roxas, you take Beast's Castle.\nXion, you go to Agrabah.
0x06ACD5F8=You don't want to pit Roxas against\nthat thing. Not by himself.
0x06ACD644=All right.
0x06ACF198=Believed what?
0x06ACF224=Uh-huh, well...\nI'd better get over to Agrabah.
0x06ACF28C=Don't think for a minute I believed that.
0x06ACF30C=That reprehensible performance.
0x06AD1F14=Roxas, that's a stick.
0x06AD1F7C=Just take it. It's fine.
0x06AD1FEC=Ben...
0x06AD2078=Hey, you managed without the Keyblade.\nYou think I'm not up to it?
0x06AD20BC=I guess...I can.
0x06AD20D8=Okay, if you're sure.\nThanks, Roxas.
0x06AD2100=Then go ahead and use it for the day.
0x06AD2198=Well...
0x06AD21D8=It's no use...
0x06AD2208=But Roxas―
0x06AD2218=I don't know what I'm gonna do starting\ntomorrow.
0x06AD2298=Maybe it'll help you remember how to\nsummon your own. 
0x06AD22D0=What are you gonna use?
0x06AD22E8=You okay?
0x06AD2340=What about my Keyblade?\nCan you control mine?
0x06AD237C=I can improvise.
0x06AD4124=You did it!
0x06AD4148=Did it help?\nDo you remember how it works now?
0x06AD41A4=I can't wait to see Axel's face when we\ntell him about this. C'mon!
0x06AD41E8=I don't believe it!\nRoxas, it worked! Thank you so much!
0x06AD4254=Thanks, Roxas.\nYou can have this back.
0x06AD431C=Okay!
0x06AD43B4=I don't know...\nLet me give it another try.
0x06AD80F4=Buy me one, and we'll call it even.
0x06AD8124=Yeah?
0x06AD8180=Very funny.\nHow'd your caper go?
0x06AD81A4=What?\nI thought it was pretty deep.
0x06AD8240=Ta-daaah!
0x06AD82F8=Pfft, me?\nI didn't do anything.
0x06AD83E4=Ahem...\nHow 'bout an ice cream, then?
0x06AD8414=Oh, loads of fun... Would it kill the\nHeartless to hold still? I fell right on\nmy butt chasing the stupid thing.
0x06AD84D8=I'd like to dedicate this Keyblade\nsummoning to my good friends Roxas\nand Axel.
0x06AD85A4=Pff...
0x06AD85AC=What's gotten into you?
0x06AD85E4=As long as we remember each other,\nwe'll never be apart. Got it memorized?
0x06AD8680=Hey hey!\nWhat are you grinning about?
0x06AD86E0=Ha ha, wow, Axel.\nThat sounded ridiculous.
0x06AD870C=Heh heh.
0x06AD8718=How was your mission?
0x06AD8730=I just...want these days to last\nforever. Hanging out, the ice cream,\nthe sunsets...
0x06AD886C=And then Xion might never have\nremembered how to use the Keyblade.
0x06AD88F4=Whew...
0x06AD88FC=I hope we always have each other.
0x06AD89A8=Thanks, Axel.
0x06AD89CC=Heh, you got it.\nWait here, I'll be right back!
0x06AD89FC=Sure you did. If you hadn't spoken up\nfor us this morning, me and Roxas\nwould've had to split up.
0x06AD8B18=Axel!
0x06AD8B34=Ha ha ha!
0x06AD8B40=Nice. Didn't I hear you tell Saïx you\nwere a big boy?
0x06AD8B78=But you know, we'll still have each\nother...even if things change and we\ncan't do this anymore.
0x06AD8BD8=Huh?
0x06AD8C18=Nothing lasts forever, man.\nLeast of all for a bunch of Nobodies.
0x06AD8C5C=Yeah...
0x06ADAE2C=Eat your ice cream before it melts.
0x06ADAE84=Shut up.
0x06ADAEB4=That's good.
0x06ADAF64=Keyblade still working?
0x06ADAFEC=I owe it all to you and Axel.
0x06ADB038=Heh heh heh.
0x06ADB048=Yeah, everything's fine now.
0x06ADB084=Hah, look at Axel!\nHe's bright red!
0x06ADE910=Ever heard of knocking?
0x06ADE98C=And the missing chamber, the Chamber\nof Waking―it holds all the answers.
0x06ADE9F8=Look, I knew Vexen and Zexion would\nbe obstacles.
0x06ADEA68=Xemnas isn't telling us something.
0x06ADEA8C=How should I know?\nI'm not spying on her.
0x06ADEAD8=......?\nBut the two of you are close.
0x06ADEBB8=Hmph.
0x06ADEC2C=Just do me a favor and don't trip on\nthe way up.
0x06ADEC60=Let me guess...
0x06ADED34=Yes, sir, thank you, sir.\nYou paid me a personal visit just to\ntell me that?
0x06ADED84=You mean the chamber.
0x06ADED9C=Two of your favorite people.
0x06ADEDEC=Naminé...and Xion?
0x06ADEE00=That castle hasn't given up all its\nsecrets.
0x06ADEE54=for our own reasons.
0x06ADEEAC=I cleared the way to the top for you.
0x06ADEEFC=Still think another visit is a waste of\ntime?
0x06ADEF2C=That's why they're not here anymore.
0x06ADEF54=We, or you?
0x06ADEF60=You're the one who wants me to go.\nDon't try and dress it up as a favor.
0x06ADF06C=Hmm...
0x06ADF0A0=So what, now I've gotta rat on my\nfriends to you?
0x06ADF0F0=A solo mission in Castle Oblivion...
0x06ADF118=Naminé isn't the only one who can trace\nher beginnings to Castle Oblivion.\nXion comes from there, too.
0x06ADF1EC=That chamber will tell you everything\nyou don't know about Xemnas's true\nagenda. Is that the idea?
0x06ADF250=We need those answers to gain the\nupper hand―
0x06ADF318=Tell me what Xion has been doing.
0x06ADF33C=And there's one in particular Lord\nXemnas is especially interested in.
0x06ADF3E4=Expect the orders soon.
0x06ADF414=Then let me give you another incentive.
0x06ADF43C=We also need you to go back to Castle\nOblivion.
0x06ADF4EC=The Chamber of Repose, and its\nantipode, the Chamber of Waking...
0x06ADF58C=Huh?
0x06ADF5E0=Hmph... Whatever.
0x06ADF5F4=We turned that place inside out.\nIf it's there, we're not gonna find it\nby just looking.
0x06ADF650=When have I ever complained about the\ndirty work?
0x06ADF6D4=Get out of my room, man.
0x06ADF718=You and Xion will be executing your\nnext mission together.
0x06AE108C=Today we get to go explore a new\nworld together.
0x06AE1208=Hah! You like “kiddo” better?\nOr maybe you're mad because Poppet\ngot the best nickname?
0x06AE12AC=Team Axel?
0x06AE132C=Yeah, he and Xion teamed up for the\nday. Which means they get to work half\nas hard. Which is so totally unfair.
0x06AE139C=Don't call me “tiger.”
0x06AE13B8=Pack up, tiger, and let's get moving.
0x06AE13E0=Ugh, never mind.
0x06AE1454=Hey, man, you missed your amigos.\nTeam Axel already left.
0x06AE1490=Today you get to work with me, tiger.
0x06AE2D98=Hey, don't ask me.
0x06AE2DAC=Hmm?
0x06AE2DB4=When I look at the water, and hear the\nwaves lapping against the shore...
0x06AE2EC0=Well, I dunno.\nMaybe these ARE memories...\nIt just seems weird that they're mine.
0x06AE2F48=But you have memories, don't you?
0x06AE2FC4=Yeah...
0x06AE2FDC=...it's almost like I can hear another\nvoice.
0x06AE3018=I guess I'm more like Roxas.\nNeither one of us remembers much.
0x06AE31B0=When I sit here with you guys, it's\nweird...
0x06AE31E0=Yeah. Not that they've ever done me\nany good.
0x06AE3234=Dis, Axel.
0x06AE3240=Hope Xigbar isn't giving him too hard a\ntime.
0x06AE3328=So...you mean you remembered\nsomething?
0x06AE3350=You know how you were talking the\nother day about how we all have pasts?
0x06AE33B4=I get the strangest feeling I used to\nwatch the sun set with somebody else.\nOr when I'm by the sea...
0x06AE341C=I wonder if he and I had this much in\ncommon before we were Nobodies.
0x06AE34E4=Hey, Axel.
0x06AE34F0=No...\nIt's not quite like that.
0x06AE3510=Roxas must be working late.
0x06AE441C=“Vacation”?\nWhat's that?
0x06AE44C8=              OPERATIONS CLOSED FOR VACATION
0x06AE5D98=But...I don't know what I like.
0x06AE5DB8=Do what you like.
0x06AE5DCC=It's not my fault I've never had one.\nI don't know what to do.
0x06AE5ED0=Me? Sleep. And once I'm done with\nthat, roll over and sleep some more.
0x06AE5F70=You kidding?\nI'd nap six times a day if they'd let me.
0x06AE6094=Is that right?
0x06AE6128=What are you gonna do, Axel?
0x06AE6148=What's your―\nRoxas, you're really missing the point.
0x06AE6194=All right, snooze-land is calling.\nEnjoy your time off!
0x06AE61EC=Don't you spend enough time in bed?
0x06AE6210=Oh, hey, Roxas.\nYou hear about the vacation?\nAbout time we had a day off.
0x06AE6274=I've never had a vacation before.
0x06AE62C0=What's my job during vacation?
0x06AE7900=Did you see the notice posted?
0x06AE7928=Yeah, I want to get really good at using\nthe Keyblade. Why don't you join me?
0x06AE7978=Yeah.
0x06AE7998=Oh, Xion!
0x06AE79A4=Well...I was thinking I'd practice.
0x06AE7A08=Really? Okay, then.\nCome find me if you change your mind.
0x06AE7AA8=Hey, Roxas, good morning.
0x06AE7AC4=Nah, I'll pass.
0x06AE7B28=Practice?
0x06AE7B84=What are we supposed to do with a day\noff?
0x06AE851C=Ice cream.
0x06AE8558=Hmm...\nWhat do I WANT to do?
0x06AE8578=What am I supposed to do?
0x06AEDA70=What do you mean, “can't tell”?
0x06AEDA94=Hah, maybe you're just out of shape!
0x06AEDAC8=I'll catch him!
0x06AEDB70=Well, they do get a little help.\nTheir teachers dish out plenty of\nhomework.
0x06AEDC1C=You know how he gets.
0x06AEDC3C=Axel went somewhere.\nHe went to sleep.
0x06AEDCE8=Hey, I'm not about to tell you ALL my\ndark secrets. Got it memorized?\nI bet you keep a thing or two from me.
0x06AEDD58=Hmm...\nI could deal with a week, maybe.
0x06AEDD80=Most kids spend summer vacation just\ngoofing off with their friends.
0x06AEDE3C=So, did you end up going anywhere?
0x06AEDE8C=Oh, before I forget... I might not see\nyou guys again for a little while.
0x06AEDF14=Ha ha, relax, would ya?\nI'm kidding.
0x06AEDF3C=Hey, unlike you two lazybones, I work\nmyself pretty hard!
0x06AEE004=Try not to bungle everything while I'm\ngone.
0x06AEE04C=Can't tell.
0x06AEE104=Huff, huff...\nWhy...do we have to play games...\nthat involve running?
0x06AEE170=Summer vacation?\nWhat's that?
0x06AEE228=Fancy meeting you here.
0x06AEE240=Hey!\nDon't make me come over there!
0x06AEE2DC=Well, considering your track record...
0x06AEE304=Heh, yeah.
0x06AEE310=Tomorrow, it's back to work.
0x06AEE330=Now, why would we do that?
0x06AEE3A8=They save the homework till the end\nand then help each other finish it.
0x06AEE42C=Where?
0x06AEE434=Yeah. I hadn't really thought about it\nmuch since becoming a Nobody.
0x06AEE524=It's classified.
0x06AEE56C=You're not getting away!\nAfter him!
0x06AEE598=Huh? Why not?
0x06AEE610=That sounds fun, I guess.
0x06AEE640=They're sending me out on recon for a\nfew days.
0x06AEE6DC=I just gotta keep my mouth shut about\nit, or else Saïx will get on my case.
0x06AEE7BC=Yeah...
0x06AEE7C4=How do they hang on to their sanity?
0x06AEE7EC=I don't have any dark secrets.
0x06AEE80C=There he goes!
0x06AEE858=I can't even figure out how to fill a\nday.
0x06AEE8C4=What's going on down there?\nAre the kids here on summer vacation?\n...Nah, can't be. It's too early.
0x06AEE930=But I thought we were friends.
0x06AEE9AC=So how'd you spend the day?
0x06AEEA2C=Trust me, it's over before you can\nblink.
0x06AEEAA4=A dream come true, that's what―\na whole month off.
0x06AEEADC=Hey, Axel.
0x06AEEB28=A month!?
0x06AEEB34=Ha ha ha!\nWhat kind of vacation is that?
0x06AEEB9C=No―why? Did you guys go somewhere\nwithout me?
0x06AEEC2C=Whew, I slept like a log.
0x06AEEC48=Hey, guys.\nHow did I know you'd be here?
0x06AEEC74=Hope we get another vacation soon.
0x06AF02E0=You've changed.
0x06AF039C=Hmph.\nWhat took you?
0x06AF03F0=It's my vacation. I can take all the\ntime I want. Since when do I have to\ncheck in with you?
0x06AF0460=Yes, sir, whatever you say.
0x06AF047C=You're letting yourself get too\nattached to them.
0x06AF36C4=You're here early.
0x06AF36D8=So where'd they send you, Roxas?
0x06AF37CC=Why would caring about something be a\nweakness?
0x06AF3804=Beast's Castle, with Xaldin.
0x06AF3824=I guess Axel's still out on that\nclassified mission, huh?
0x06AF392C=Really?
0x06AF395C=Yeah, but Xaldin says that's a\nweakness.
0x06AF3988=You remember the castle's master,\nXion?
0x06AF39BC=I dunno, I didn't get it either.
0x06AF3A10=I hope Axel comes home soon.
0x06AF3A30=Yeah, the beast we saw.\n
0x06AF3A9C=Work was easy today.
0x06AF3B08=Well, you were right. He does have\nsomething he wants to protect.\nSomething he cares about.
0x06AF4E58=She's not here yet.
0x06AF4E9C=This isn't like her...
0x06AF4ECC=Hunh.
0x06AF4F18=Hey, Roxas!
0x06AF4F78=Hmm...
0x06AF4FC4=It's getting late.
0x06AF4FF0=Axel... You're back!
0x06AF5028=How ya holding up?\nWhere's Xion?
0x06AF504C=Yup, I just got home.
0x06AF57B8=How could he say that...
0x06AF5F38=He's wrong.\nIt's not a sham...and neither am I.
0x06AF7684=Xion?
0x06AF76BC=Just give me another chance!
0x06AF76DC=We can't afford to expend any more\nchances on you.
0x06AF7710=You were a mistake we never should\nhave made.
0x06AFA2E0=Haven't seen her today, either.
0x06AFA320=Why don't I have anything like that?
0x06AFA348=You've got memories from here in the\nOrganization, right?
0x06AFA450=Scary?\nScary's a feeling, man.
0x06AFA478=It's still a scary thought.
0x06AFA534=Where's Xion?
0x06AFA550=Ah...
0x06AFA558=Hey, Axel...
0x06AFA568=Yeah...
0x06AFA5E8=A thought, then.\nBut not a feeling.
0x06AFA618=Everybody's got something they want to\nhang on to.
0x06AFA6AC=I couldn't bear to lose my memories of\nyou or Xion.
0x06AFA758=Oh well.
0x06AFA764=Well, he had something like that.\nSomething so important to him he\ncouldn't bear to lose it.
0x06AFA7D0=But Demyx doesn't have a heart, and I\nbet he'd get upset if you took his sitar\naway.
0x06AFA828=It's scary to think I could lose you\nguys.
0x06AFA854=What?\nWhere'd that come from?
0x06AFA884=I do, don't I?
0x06AFA894=Are you sure?
0x06AFA8B4=Hmm, true, but...I don't think that's\nquite the same.
0x06AFA8EC=Maybe you just remember what it's like\nto feel scared, and think you're feeling\nit now.
0x06AFA9E4=Uhh, I guess...
0x06AFA9F4=I guess the closest thing we Nobodies\nhave got is our past.
0x06AFAAB4=Oh...\nToo bad I don't remember MY past.
0x06AFAB50=Well, see? There ya go.
0x06AFABC0=I ran into somebody today, and...
0x06AFAC04=Is there anything you couldn't bear to\nlose?
0x06AFAC64=You know, memories of the stuff we\ncouldn't bear to lose, back when we\ncouldn't bear to lose it.
0x06AFAD10=Huh?
0x06AFAD8C=Well, what about your present?
0x06AFAE18=Because you don't have a heart.
0x06AFAE48=Yeah, I know I can't feel, but...
0x06AFD678=Don't you have a mission?
0x06AFD714=Let's double up our missions.\nIf we team up, we should be able to cut\nthrough the work faster.
0x06AFD77C=Roxas, I'm sorry.
0x06AFD79C=Huh? How?
0x06AFD7A8=I was upset.\nI messed up a mission really bad.
0x06AFD800=Oh...
0x06AFD808=Really?\nMe too...
0x06AFD81C=Well...okay.\nMaybe we'll finish early and have more\ntime for ice cream.
0x06AFD888=Don't be. That jerk can say whatever\nhe wants. I can take it.
0x06AFD8C8=I don't suppose you heard about the\nguy pretending to be one of us?\nThe Organization impostor?
0x06AFD928=I was ordered to take him out...but I\ncouldn't beat him.
0x06AFD964=Oh...\nGosh, I'm sorry...
0x06AFDA24=Yeah. They sent me here today.
0x06AFDA84=Whatever, it didn't bother me.
0x06AFDAD4=Roxas?
0x06AFDAF0=Saïx was so mad, he called me a\n“mistake.”
0x06AFDB4C=Hey, Xion!
0x06AFDB88=Hey, Xion...\nWhy don't we work together today?
0x06AFDBB8=I shouldn't have run off like that\nyesterday.
0x06AFEBB8=Guess we got the work done a little\nTOO fast, huh?
0x06AFECA0=Wonder where Axel is.
0x06B01A14=Maybe.
0x06B01A1C=...Special just means different.
0x06B01AD4=Heya, Roxas!
0x06B01B2C=Sorry.\nMy mind's on other things.
0x06B01B50=Well, if it makes you feel any better,\nXigbar said you and me were pretty\nspecial. “Exceptional,” he said.
0x06B01BC0=Well, we may both be exceptional,\nRoxas.
0x06B01C10=Xion?\nHey... Xion!
0x06B01C40=I just wish I knew what I was doing here.\nHow I got here...
0x06B01CDC=Because I'm a mistake.
0x06B01D6C=I don't know.
0x06B01D7C=I started having the strangest dreams.
0x06B01E28=What do you mean, why?\nSo we can get hearts of our own,\nright?
0x06B01E68=Xion, attends...
0x06B01E94=But I don't think we're the same.
0x06B01F00=What's the matter with you today?
0x06B01F2C=Really?
0x06B01F34=Why?\nWhat do we need hearts for?
0x06B01F7C=You're not a mistake.
0x06B01F94=But I figure once we have them, we'll\nbe in a better position to judge.
0x06B01FDC=Hey, Axel.
0x06B0208C=Roxas, why are we doing all this?\nWorking for the Organization?
0x06B02158=You just missed her.
0x06B0217C=Right?
0x06B0219C=Xion couldn't make it again today?
0x06B021FC=I can never remember what they're\nabout. I just wake up feeling like...\nlike something is really wrong.
0x06B02264=Xion, wait―
0x06B047F8=I am so lost.
0x06B04850=You mean...real people are more\ncomplex than us?
0x06B04890=But don't take it personal.\nMost Nobodies aren't.
0x06B048C4=Hmm...yeah...\nWish you'd told me that before.
0x06B04904=You're all right, kid.
0x06B0491C=Because if you rush in there and try\nto fix things, you'll just press more\nbuttons.
0x06B04970=How did you know that's what I was\nthinking?
0x06B049A0=Single dose.
0x06B049B0=Well, sure! Especially if they're real\nand female. That's like a double dose\nof complicated.
0x06B04A10=Why?
0x06B04A60=Well, just give her some time.
0x06B04AC0=So...what about a Nobody girl like Xion?
0x06B04B1C=Did something happen yesterday?
0x06B04B3C=Nah, it's nothing.
0x06B04B50=You'll patch things up with her.\nTrust me.
0x06B04B98=Stop laughing!
0x06B04BDC=Don't call me “kid”!
0x06B04BF8=Don't hold your breath.
0x06B04C10=I hope so.
0x06B04D90=Hey! No Xion?
0x06B04DC4=Girls sure are complicated, huh?
0x06B04DE8=Got it memorized?
0x06B04E3C=Well, the important thing to remember\nwhen dealing with girls is not to push\nthe wrong buttons.
0x06B04F14=Fine, whatever.
0x06B04F9C=Because you're not so complicated.
0x06B05A74=All by myself today, I guess...
0x06B06E2C=All by yourself again?
0x06B06EC4=They've been keeping me busy lately.\nXion, too.
0x06B06EF4=Yeah.
0x06B06F0C=What face...
0x06B06F1C=Yeah, no kidding.
0x06B06F44=C'mon, what's with the face?
0x06B0AC34=I'll call that thing whatever I want.\nHow we deal with Xion is no concern of\nyours.
0x06B0ACA0=She bungled her last mission and has\nbeen in a deep sleep ever since. Can't\nwin them all, I suppose.
0x06B0AD08=To see Xion.
0x06B0AD64=Don't call her that!
0x06B0AD7C=I didn't ask you if it was!
0x06B0ADC8=Roxas.\nHow has the game been treating you?
0x06B0AE8C=Saïx shuffled us together for today's\nmission. I wager we'll make a good\nenough team.
0x06B0AEF0=And where do you think you are going,\nRoxas?
0x06B0AF20=But you have a mission.
0x06B0AF98=We're all Nobodies!
0x06B0B010=No, what!?
0x06B0B03C=What do you care?\nThe creature is broken. Defective.
0x06B0B074=Won't affect my―\nWhat is WRONG with you?\nLook, I'll do my mission―later.
0x06B0B0C4=You cannot help your comrade.\nXion will not wake up.
0x06B0B16C=That's not the point!\nI should still be with her.
0x06B0B1A0=Oh, by the way, did you hear about what\nhappened to Xion?
0x06B0B1DC=Which I'll do!
0x06B0B250=Uhh...fine, I guess.
0x06B0B268=Voir Xion.
0x06B0B388=I don't see why not.
0x06B0B440=Xion!
0x06B0B454=Look at you, Roxas.\nUp in arms over a nobody.
0x06B0B484=Settle down. Xion's failings won't\naffect your standing with us. You've\nnothing to worry about.
0x06B0C1C4=Oh, Xion...
0x06B0C210=Xion...
0x06B0E41C=I just hope she wakes up soon.
0x06B0E470=Saïx knows something about her.
0x06B0E494=When I saw her lying there...\nI couldn't stop thinking that she'll\nnever wake up.
0x06B0E584=If it's gonna keep you up at night,\nI could ask him for you.
0x06B0E608=I don't know how real people talk.
0x06B0E62C=Saïx called her “broken.”
0x06B0E64C=True.
0x06B0E660=I mean, sometimes you sound like you\nreally are heartsick or something.
0x06B0E6A8=Yes, really! Sheesh, sit down.\nI'll ask, but don't get your hopes up.
0x06B0E744=He's more likely to tell you than he is\nme.
0x06B0E7EC=Axel, about Xion...
0x06B0E93C=Well, if it cheers you up, I'm probably\na lot more broken than her.
0x06B0E980=Well...
0x06B0E9A0=Listen to you.
0x06B0E9FC=Really!?
0x06B0EA34=Hmm...
0x06B0EA3C=Saïx told me what happened this\nmorning.
0x06B0EA68=Straight answers aren't exactly his\nspecialty.
0x06B0EA98=Why? What did I say?
0x06B0EAD4=Why does he hate her so much?
0x06B0EAF4=Why me and her are special Nobodies.
0x06B0EB1C=How come you do that?\nTalk like you're a real person.
0x06B0EB54=She will.
0x06B0FCD0=Just like you're always honest with me?
0x06B0FDA8=Okay, you've got me there.
0x06B0FDC4=What is it you two see in that thing?\nJust look at it.
0x06B0FDFC=Xion has no right to be among our\nnumber.
0x06B0FE40=And I told you I can't.\nI have to know what Xion's deal is.
0x06B0FE7C=Why can't you be straight with me for\nonce?
0x06B0FEE8=...Hey, that was uncalled for!
0x06B0FF28=I warned you to keep out of this.
0x06B0FFF4=Why not?
0x06B122E4=Find out anything about Xion?
0x06B12304=I will! Thanks, Axel.\nThat's great news!
0x06B12348=The best thing you can do for her now\nis keep up the good work.
0x06B12470=Ugh, sorry, Roxas...
0x06B12488=I talked to Saïx.
0x06B12550=That's okay.
0x06B12580=But he did say he would take back\ncalling her broken―IF she proves\nherself more capable going forward.
0x06B125EC=Hey, Roxas.
0x06B125F8=His...his lips were sealed.\nSorry, man, I tried.
0x06B1262C=Really!?\nWhat did he say?
0x06B13C74=Right...
0x06B13C88=I wish Xion would wake up so I could\ntell her all about it.
0x06B13D74=There's just no way to describe it.\nI've been waiting all day to tell you\nand Xion!
0x06B13DE0=I can imagine.
0x06B13EB8=All done with work?
0x06B13EE8=Flew?
0x06B13EF0=I flew today.
0x06B13F10=Yup.
0x06B13F30=Axel, you're not gonna believe this.
0x06B13FC0=Flying felt so natural―like I'd done it\nbefore. Weird, huh?
0x06B14000=Yeah, like a bird! Well, sort of.\nIt's hard to explain...
0x06B15CA0=Can I come, too?
0x06B15CE8=Xion...\nGood morning.
0x06B15D00=All right... Sure.
0x06B15D14=Huh? Oh, I'm about to head out.
0x06B15D34=Morning...
0x06B15D40=Yeah.\nMe and Axel were getting worried.
0x06B15D68=Huh?
0x06B15D70=S-sorry...
0x06B15DF4=That long!?
0x06B15E5C=Whoa!
0x06B15E64=Yeah...
0x06B15E88=But...don't you need more rest?
0x06B15F04=Hey, don't you have work?
0x06B15F20=Kind of...weird that we can feel\nanything at all, huh? Without hearts\nto feel with.
0x06B15FFC=About twenty days.
0x06B16048=You brought me seashells.
0x06B16064=You startled me.
0x06B16078=After sleeping for three weeks?\nI'll be fine. C'mon, take me with you.
0x06B16148=Yeah, the sound of the waves.
0x06B16174=How long was I asleep?
0x06B1618C=I'm sorry.\nI feel bad.
0x06B161A4=Do you hear it?
0x06B161B4=Pardon.
0x06B18AB0=Oh, hey, Xion!\nAbout time you crawled out of bed.
0x06B18B74=Don't keep me pent up in here.\nI need the exercise.
0x06B18BB0=Hmm...
0x06B18BB8=Saïx, I want to go with Roxas today on\nhis mission.
0x06B18C10=Well, well. It lives.\nThere's just no keeping you down.
0x06B18C70=Fine.\nGo, if that's what suits you.
0x06B18CD8=Roxas will team up with Axel today, as\nscheduled. Xion, I'm afraid I neglected\nto pencil you in.
0x06B18ED4=I'll look after her.\nI promise not to let her out of my sight.
0x06B18F14=Morning, Axel.
0x06B18F24=You belong in your room.
0x06B1A428=Xion!
0x06B1BC54=I've got Xion.\nYou take out the target!
0x06B1BCA4=Okay!
0x06B1D3EC=It's okay. She's not hurt.
0x06B1D464=Let's just RTC, all right?
0x06B1D488=Xion!
0x06B1D4C8=But Axel―
0x06B1D4E4=Sora...
0x06B1F838=Does the past mean nothing to you now?
0x06B1F860=Keep your mouth shut.
0x06B1F8AC=You have changed...
0x06B1F950=She's not an “it”!
0x06B1F9A8=Well, that didn't take long.\nDid it break again?
0x06B1FA5C=Something at Castle Oblivion changed\nyou.
0x06B21D40=I just got a little dizzy.\nSorry to worry you guys.
0x06B21D94=Heh heh...
0x06B21DA0=I will.\nThanks.
0x06B21DF4=Huh?
0x06B21DFC=I meet up with you two every day for\nice cream, right? Why do I do that?
0x06B21E60=Yeah...\nYeah, you said it!
0x06B21EC8=I mean, you think about it, I don't need\nto go out of my way, right?
0x06B21F18=That's right―get it memorized.\nAnd you know what? Best friends are\nwilling to deal with complications.
0x06B21F84=What do you mean?
0x06B21F98=Because you're my best friends.\nThe three of us...we're inseparable.
0x06B21FE0=Doesn't seem like you.
0x06B22018=We are?
0x06B22038=Are you worried about her, Axel?
0x06B2205C=Of course I am.
0x06B220A0=I guess not.
0x06B221A4=Roxas...
0x06B221BC=Feeling better?
0x06B221CC=Try not to scare us like that anymore,\nhuh?
0x06B2220C=Okay.
0x06B22254=And you take it easy today.
0x06B2227C=You wanna know why I do?
0x06B22300=You hate complications.
0x06B22344=Thanks, Axel.\nYou're sweet.
0x06B23E08=                     THE TRUTH ABOUT NAMINÉ\n                                   Vexen
0x06B25E70=You're here early.
0x06B25EE4=Aw, I don't do anything special.\nAxel's the one who sticks up for us.
0x06B25F84=My mission wasn't that hard.
0x06B25FA4=Well, I'm just glad the two of you are\nin the Organization with me.
0x06B25FF0=Hey, where's Axel?
0x06B26004=I haven't seen him.
0x06B26158=Hope Axel turns up.
0x06B2616C=So, how ya feeling?
0x06B261E4=You and him are always there for me.
0x06B26214=I think I'll be okay now.
0x06B26230=Okay.
0x06B26244=It's getting late...\nI don't think he's coming.
0x06B26274=That's good.
0x06B26284=You wanna wait a little longer?
0x06B285A0=Heh, if you only knew.
0x06B28618=You flew?
0x06B28624=You think that sparkly dust would work\nin other worlds?
0x06B286B4=Yeah. There's this sparkly dust that\nmakes it possible.
0x06B28754=I dunno about that...
0x06B28784=Sorry I'm late.\nI had my hands full today.
0x06B288CC=Wow, you two sure flew through your\nmission.
0x06B2892C=Nah, it's nothing...
0x06B28944=So I was about to tell you, today me\nand Axel actually flew!
0x06B289C8=I was wondering why you two looked so\nhappy. Lucky...
0x06B28A00=What's wrong?\nDid something happen again?
0x06B28A2C=Xion...
0x06B2D038=The beach?\nWhere did that come from?
0x06B2D060=I gotta go.
0x06B2D06C=Yeah, exactly.
0x06B2D0EC=But they never send me or Roxas.
0x06B2D110=I'll join you...if I can.
0x06B2D18C=Hey, Xion.\nGet here early?
0x06B2D1A8=What, don't you wanna go someplace\ndifferent for a change?
0x06B2D1E4=Yeah.\nI breezed right through my mission.
0x06B2D218=Hey hey.\nOh, Xion, what are you doing here?
0x06B2D250=Let's go to the beach next time we get\na day off.
0x06B2D284=Ugh, you'll never believe what Xigbar\ndid...
0x06B2D2D0=Hey, Axel?
0x06B2D314=So...it would just be the three of us?
0x06B2D33C=Yup.
0x06B2D3F8=Dis, Axel.
0x06B2D404=Huh? Got what?
0x06B2D480=So, how'd your day go?
0x06B2D4B0=C'mon, that's not what I meant.
0x06B2D57C=Are you feeling all right?\nMaybe you need to rest.
0x06B2D600=Seems like people are getting sent\nthere all the time. Especially you.
0x06B2D648=You'll have a blast, trust me.
0x06B2D668=You've been to Castle Oblivion, right?
0x06B2D690=Well...all right, sure.\nLet's do it.
0x06B2D6B8=Well...they probably just don't need you\nthere, that's all.
0x06B2D75C=No, it's nothing like that.
0x06B2D778=The Organization uses it as a research\nfacility.
0x06B2D7AC=Uh-huh?
0x06B2D7B4=I've got it!
0x06B2D81C=What, do you want me to leave?\nSheesh.
0x06B2D844=Huh?
0x06B2D858=Maybe.
0x06B2D860=Of course you can, Xion.
0x06B2D8A8=What's it like?
0x06B3015C=Hope we get some more vacation soon.\nWe could all use that trip to the beach.
0x06B301AC=Right...
0x06B301E0=She left.
0x06B30248=Oh, sorry.\nI guess I'm just tired.
0x06B3026C=Where's Xion?
0x06B3027C=You wanna sit down?
0x06B302C4=No, I'm gonna go.\nSee you later.
0x06B30318=Okay...
0x06B30334=What, all by your lonesome?
0x06B30388=Aren't you gonna have some ice cream?
0x06B30428=Xion?
0x06B3046C=She's been acting kind of weird lately,\ndon't ya think?
0x06B304B8=She'll be okay.\nDon't stress it.
0x06B30534=If you say so.
0x06B30578=Hmm...
0x06B30580=Hey, Axel.
0x06B3058C=Maybe she's not feeling well.
0x06B311CC=Where is it?
0x06B311F0=No, no...
0x06B31230=Got it!
0x06B33800=Ha ha!\nWell no, apparently you don't!
0x06B338BC=I also instructed him to clear out our\nfacilities there. He should RTC soon.
0x06B33980=Our plans remain unchanged.
0x06B3399C=Still missing, sir.
0x06B33A34=Nonsense.\nI see no problem whatsoever.
0x06B33A78=But sir, Xion...\nIf we don't take steps―
0x06B33B14=Little Poppet is turning into a problem―\nand I think you catch my meaning.
0x06B33B68=Axel, Roxas, and Xion will play the\nroles Kingdom Hearts has chosen for\nthem.
0x06B33D2C=Somebody accessed our main computer\nwithout authorization.
0x06B33D80=Why, Xigbar...\nIt almost sounds as though you know.
0x06B33DB4=Hmph.
0x06B33DBC=If people see with their hearts, Saïx,\nthen you're even blinder than the rest\nof us.
0x06B33E7C=Missing indeed. Ha ha!\nWherever could she be? 
0x06B33EAC=The only steps we need take are two:\nwatch...and wait.
0x06B33F0C=Xion is marching right into the arms of\ndestiny.
0x06B33F4C=I sent Axel to Castle Oblivion last night\non short notice, to help expedite the\nmatter we spoke of.
0x06B33FB0=Something you find amusing?
0x06B3408C=What else?
0x06B3409C=And Naminé?
0x06B340AC=Take steps? How can you not see how\nperfect this is?
0x06B340E4=“Somebody”? Are we all gonna pretend\n we don't know who?
0x06B37A2C=Have not.
0x06B37AC8=I have dreams every night.\nYou're in them, Axel!
0x06B37AFC=This is the last you'll ever see of\nthese walls, Xion.
0x06B37B78=Don't lie to me!\nI know this is where I come from!\nThe answers are here.
0x06B37BF4=No, I didn't say that.
0x06B37C0C=Turn around and go home, Xion.
0x06B37C2C=Weren't you given some other mission?
0x06B37C6C=Axel...
0x06B37C74=Because I'm useless?
0x06B37DC0=Hey―stop!\nXion, stay out of there!
0x06B37DE8=Nngh...my head...
0x06B37DFC=Orders.\nNothing to do with you.
0x06B37E38=You can't fool me. We've met before,\nAxel, right here in this castle!
0x06B37EA8=I'm not sure what you thought you'd\nfind in an empty place like this.
0x06B37F40=Or else what?\nThey'll turn me into a Dusk?
0x06B37F90=Please, Axel, just...help me!\nI need to know who I am.
0x06B37FC8=You can't just throw orders to the\nwind, Xion.
0x06B38078=Axel, I'm remembering things...\nAbout who I was.
0x06B380AC=Go home, Xion.\nDon't keep Roxas waiting.
0x06B381AC=Then they sure ain't memories.\nHow could I be part of your past?\nUse your head, Xion.
0x06B3823C=Well, stop remembering.\nNothing good will come of it.
0x06B38318=Not even a Dusk. They'll skip right\npast that and destroy you outright.
0x06B383C0=What are you...doing here...?
0x06B39648=I'm not sure she's gonna show today.
0x06B396EC=Oh...\nSo when's she coming back?
0x06B39710=She...
0x06B39724=Heh, fair enough.
0x06B39738=Pretty cool, huh?
0x06B39768=Roxas...
0x06B39774=Well, I guess that depends on how well\nshe does her job, right?
0x06B397C8=Did she collapse again?
0x06B3983C=...What, didn't you hear?\nShe got sent on a really important\nmission.
0x06B39F9C=Then...I'm not...\nThe person I was before...wasn't me.
0x06B3A010=No...
0x06B3C9F4=Rrgh...
0x06B3C9FC=What? Why not!?
0x06B3CA78=Grr...
0x06B3CA80=On the contrary.\nNo one is to go looking for Xion without\nmy express permission.
0x06B3CBD0=Hmm... Which means, if the time doesn't\ncome, things can stay as they are...
0x06B3CC20=Xion is gone.
0x06B3CC30=Your “friend” will be left alone.\nOr would you rather we find some\npunishment?
0x06B3CCA0=I'd rather you get her back!
0x06B3CCD0=And why would we do that?
0x06B3CD18=What!? Whoa whoa, time out...\nYou mean she, like, flew the coop?
0x06B3CD68=All will be revealed when the time\ncomes.
0x06B3CE10=Lord Xemnas has spoken.\nObey, or face your end.
0x06B3CE9C=Hah, preposterous. What would drive\nher to choose her own demise?
0x06B3DBE4=Axel could've shown up at least.
0x06B3E7C4=Xion... Axel...
0x06B3E7D4=Xion... Axel...\nWhere are you?
0x06B40A84=DiZ would be furious.
0x06B40A9C=Did you know her face was blank at\nfirst?
0x06B40B10=So what's the solution?
0x06B40B28=What happened?
0x06B40C20=If they're still separate...then yes,\nI think so.
0x06B40C54=It's too late either way.\nHis awakening will have to be delayed.
0x06B40C98=Some inside her, some inside Sora...\nothers inside Sora's Nobody...
0x06B40D70=I would need to untangle her memory\nbefore I could finish Sora's...
0x06B40DB4=If I try to just jump in and rearrange\nher memory...
0x06B40E38=...then I risk Sora waking up to find out\nthat nobody remembers him anymore.
0x06B40EAC=They're escaping through Sora's\nNobody into a third person―
0x06B40EEC=You can't get the memories back out?
0x06B40F14=and now they're starting to become a\npart of her.
0x06B40F6C=How can that be?
0x06B40F80=I wasn't sure I'd see you again.
0x06B41060=I'm sorry... I'm not sure I've kept\nthat promise very well.
0x06B4109C=What was supposed to take months\nmight take years.
0x06B410DC=But if they join with her memories,\nthings get a lot more complicated.
0x06B41158=I never imagined Sora's Nobody and\nthe other one would fight so hard to\nbe their own people.
0x06B411EC=To look after Sora.\nI remember.
0x06B41268=I can't do that to him.
0x06B41298=Some of Sora's memories are missing.
0x06B41330=Only now can you see someone.
0x06B413A4=That proves some of Sora's memories\nare inside her.
0x06B413D8=Unfortunately, the only real solution...\nis for them both to go away.
0x06B41420=You made me a promise.
0x06B41488=I can't sort it out anymore.\nAll I can do is pick up the pieces once\nwhat has to be done, is done.
0x06B41624=All right, then.
0x06B43420=Been that long, huh?
0x06B43440=I probably imagined it.
0x06B4347C=Huh?\nBut Xemnas's orders...
0x06B434A0=To be honest, I'm not even sure\ntoday's mission really happened.
0x06B434E4=Well, I think I only saw her there\nbecause I wanted her to be there.
0x06B4352C=You wanna go look for her?
0x06B435F8=Okay...\nYeah, it's a deal!
0x06B43614=There was this girl there who looked\nkind of like Xion...
0x06B43650=Wow, you're actually up here.
0x06B43754=...but I couldn't get close enough to\ntell for sure.
0x06B4378C=I feel like I just woke up from a dream\nor something.
0x06B437C4=Orders, shmorders. Starting tomorrow,\nlet's use our spare time between work\nand coming here to try and find Xion.
0x06B43854=This is gonna sound crazy, but you\nknow how we promised each other we'd\nall go to the beach?
0x06B439D4=I got to go to the beach today for my\nmission.
0x06B46FE4=Right...
0x06B47004=Yeah, but...\nThe place has been cleaned out, man.\nThere's nothing there.
0x06B47058=And the day before she disappeared,\nyou said she was put on an important\nmission.
0x06B470AC=I've been everywhere I know how to\nget to.
0x06B47150=That's probably why she was asking\nabout it.
0x06B47180=Xion might be there.
0x06B47198=Xion was asking about it, remember?
0x06B47218=Poor Xion...
0x06B472E8=Hey, neither did I.
0x06B472FC=I only found out about it a little while\nago myself.
0x06B4736C=She must have a lot of questions.
0x06B473CC=What? Really!?
0x06B47474=You know...that's where she comes\nfrom. Castle Oblivion.
0x06B474BC=I had no idea...
0x06B474D0=It's no use.\nWe're never gonna find her.
0x06B474FC=The only place I haven't looked is\nCastle Oblivion.
0x06B4754C=You sure there isn't someplace you're\nforgetting to check?
0x06B48E40=Castle Oblivion?\nI'll go.
0x06B48EB0=Not by yourself, you won't.\nThis target is extremely dangerous.
0x06B48F50=All right, better.\nGo, then, and teach this fraud the\nprice for wearing our coat.
0x06B48FA4=Impostor?\nYou mean the one that Xion...
0x06B49070=I know C.O. better than anybody else in\nthis outfit.
0x06B49104=He's prowling about Castle Oblivion as\nwe speak.
0x06B4917C=The impostor has been sighted again.
0x06B491A4=Then how 'bout I tag along?
0x06B4BD68=So, this is Castle Oblivion...
0x06B4BE60=No, wait...\nThere's something... I can almost...
0x06B4BF14=Hey, easy, man!\nC'mon, let's retreat for now and―
0x06B4BF48=No...\nWe have to...find Xion...
0x06B4BF84=Roxas!
0x06B4BFDC=Roxas!?
0x06B4BFE4=We're leaving. Now!
0x06B4C018=Agh, my...my head!
0x06B4C054=All these...pictures...rushing into my\nhead...
0x06B4C084=Wh...what's happening?
0x06B4F7E4=Xion, wait!
0x06B4F86C=Hey!
0x06B4F880=I remember going in, that's it.
0x06B4F8B8=Giving up already?\nI thought you were stronger than that.
0x06B4F904=Rrgh...\nGet out of the way!
0x06B4F938=Hey, you should take a breather.
0x06B4F95C=I'm fine.\nWe need to go back to C.O.
0x06B4F994=What happened to me?
0x06B4FA10=Xion?
0x06B4FA74=Roxas, wait up!
0x06B4FA84=Who's there?
0x06B4FA94=You collapsed right inside the castle\ndoors. Don't you remember?
0x06B4FB2C=RIKU!
0x06B4FB44=Hah, I don't think so.
0x06B4FBD0=Whoa, you okay there?
0x06B52368=Ain't no way that was Xion!
0x06B52384=I thought the impostor was sighted in\nCastle Oblivion! What's he doing here?
0x06B5248C=Xion...
0x06B524D0=You want to go back?
0x06B52558=The other one was.\nThe one who escaped before.
0x06B52600=But...I don't get it.\nWhy would she run from me?
0x06B53360=Why would she do that?
0x06B533AC=At least we know she's safe.\nShe'll come home when she's ready.
0x06B5344C=Who was that guy she was with?\nWhy is she cooperating with him?
0x06B53498=But won't they turn her into a Dusk?
0x06B534C0=Not necessarily.
0x06B549C4=Tell me what choice is left, now that\nXion has had contact with that man in\nthe black coat.
0x06B54A40=Um, Axel?
0x06B54A98=You're ordering me to what!?
0x06B56E34=Go and destroy him, Roxas―like I\nexpected you to do yesterday.
0x06B56F80=Axel, you bring Xion back.\nGagged and tied up, for all I care.
0x06B56FFC=The impostor has resurfaced in\nTwilight Town.
0x06B57048=Rrgh...
0x06B57050=You just worry about yourself, huh?\nThat guy in the coat didn't look like the\ntype to go down without a fight.
0x06B57144=Relax. I'll think of something clever\nonce I find her.
0x06B571F8=He might be forcing her.
0x06B572A8=I think we all know, and you just don't\nwant to accept it.
0x06B5731C=You're not actually gonna follow those\norders?
0x06B5739C=Get going.
0x06B573A8=If that proves too troublesome, then\nyou are authorized to adopt a more\npermanent solution.
0x06B57420=That's not evidence!\nWho knows why she was with him?
0x06B57458=You saw the creature consorting with\nthat impostor. What more evidence do\nwe need?
0x06B574F0=Well, this is pretty icky, huh?
0x06B57564=What? Saïx, no!
0x06B57578=Xion has betrayed us.
0x06B575B0=It's not a display!\nWhy is it such a crime to give each\nother the benefit of the doubt?
0x06B57684=Ha! Spare me your repulsive displays\nof would-be sentiment.
0x06B576C0=I know.
0x06B576F8=What? No!
0x06B599A8=Axel!
0x06B599FC=Didn't I?
0x06B59A40=Do what?
0x06B59A84=Safe.
0x06B59A9C=You didn't have to use force.
0x06B59AE0=How could you do that to her?
0x06B59B00=If that's all, I gotta go.
0x06B59B3C=This isn't about friendship.
0x06B59B5C=Where is she?
0x06B59BB8=No... Of course not!\nWe're supposed to be best friends.
0x06B59BF0=Oh, hey, Roxas.
0x06B59C60=(If that's all!?)
0x06B5B64C=I wasn't aware she had returned.
0x06B5B670=Unless HE does...
0x06B5B694=So you haven't seen her around?
0x06B5B73C=Doesn't anybody know what happened\nto her?
0x06B5B768=That is generally what “wasn't aware\nshe had returned” means, yes.
0x06B5B8DC=Have you seen Xion?
0x06B5B8F0=Xion?\nWhy would I know where she is?
0x06B5C948=I need to ask you something.
0x06B5C9E0=What happened to Xion?\nCan you tell me?
0x06B5CA18=And what would that be?
0x06B5CAC8=Put your mind at ease.\nXion is a valued member of the\nOrganization, but she needs her rest.
0x06B5DD08=I will have Xion return to her duties\ntomorrow. Today, you must focus on\nyours.
0x06B5DDB8=He is what makes you and Xion a part\nof each other's lives.
0x06B5DDF4=He's the connection.
0x06B5DE0C=...\nSora.
0x06B5DE18=And if you want her to stay that way,\nI must insist you get your mind off\nthese needless distractions.
0x06B5DF08=...Sora.
0x06B5DFFC=The what?
0x06B5E018=All right.
0x06B5E034=Just as he is the reason I placed Xion\namong our number.
0x06B5E070=Who is Sora?
0x06B5EF40=Hey, Roxas.
0x06B60048=I see.\nAnd what do you want to do about the\nimpostor in black?
0x06B600D4=I was ready to scrap the whole\nproject...
0x06B6010C=Keeping her close to Roxas will prevent\nSora from ever waking.
0x06B60250=I will admit, Xion has strayed from our\noriginal designs.
0x06B6028C=Really?
0x06B60294=Then, it occurred to me: Xion is keeping\nSora's memories trapped by claiming\nthem as her own.
0x06B602F4=Xion's exposure to Roxas effected a\ntransfer of its power, just as we had\nhoped.
0x06B603AC=But then, through Roxas, Sora himself\nbegan to shape “it” into “her,” giving\nXion a sense of identity.
0x06B60580=Then we are back on track.
0x06B60628=Had things stopped there, Xion would\nhave been an unequivocal success.
0x06B60670=That gadfly? See that he stays away\nfrom Roxas. He only poses a threat if\nhis buzzing reaches Xion's ears.
0x06B60714=But this unpredictable behavior is\nproving to have an interesting side\neffect.
0x06B60764=We wanted the Key.
0x06B60778=Are you certain we've taken suitable\nmeasures with Xion and Roxas?
0x06B61DD8=Riku, what should I do?
0x06B63F4C=Yes...
0x06B63F60=But...what'll happen to...
0x06B63FC4=Unless something is done, he'll never\nwake from his slumber.
0x06B64034=Those Nobodies had no business existing\nin the first place―as you know fully\nwell, Naminé.
0x06B640A0=Oh no...
0x06B640C4=Stopped?
0x06B640F4=Then so be it.\nThe gloves must come off.
0x06B6416C=It's Sora...\nHis memory has stopped.
0x06B641B8=What has happened?
0x06B65704=Wh-what...\nDid something get in my eyes?
0x06B66600=Huh?
0x06B66620=End of the line.
0x06B66634=I remember this...
0x06B66648=It's a keyhole. See?
0x06B675C0=You look so much like him.
0x06B67638=Tu lui ressembles tellement.
0x06B67690=Y-yeah...
0x06B6769C=You okay?
0x06B676B4=...What?
0x06B69CF4=Using the Keyblade these days...\nI don't know what's wrong with me―\nI just run out of steam.
0x06B69DB8='Course I am.\nC'mon, Xion, let's RTC.
0x06B69E94=How did I just do that?
0x06B69EB4=Where did that power come from?
0x06B69ED4=Yeah...
0x06B69F38=H-how...
0x06B69FB0=You know what, never mind.\nI'm probably just overworked, heh.
0x06B6A010=Roxas?
0x06B6A018=You sure you're okay?
0x06B6A030=You...you do?
0x06B6A058=Hey, are you all right?
0x06B6BB40=Usually, I do all the worrying over you.\nI don't think it's ever been the other\nway around before.
0x06B6BC18=It's just not the same without all three\nof us...
0x06B6BCCC=Why?
0x06B6BCDC=I guess he's not coming today.
0x06B6BCFC=You want him to?
0x06B6BD64=So he's a jerk now?
0x06B6BD78=You're really, really okay?
0x06B6BDF8=Just feels strange, that's all.
0x06B6BE18=Since when do you ever worry about\nme?
0x06B6BEE8=Okay, you're starting to weird me out.
0x06B6BF10=Roxas, I wouldn't be sitting here with\nyou if Axel hadn't done that.
0x06B6BFD0=He's your best friend.
0x06B6BFE8=I'm glad you're back, Xion.\nI just wish Axel didn't have to be so\nrough with you.
0x06B6C108=So are you.
0x06B6C134=Well, excuse me!
0x06B6C148=Well, for your information...\nI worry about you all the time, Roxas.
0x06B6C190=What, did you two have a fight?
0x06B6C1B8=I can't believe that jerk would actually\nattack you.
0x06B6E9F0=What? No...I just...
0x06B6EA10=Axel!
0x06B6EA3C=Why...why would you say that?
0x06B6EA74=And suddenly I find myself fighting the\nsame way he does...
0x06B6EAE4=You need something?
0x06B6EB00=Oh, you're not sure?\nWhat, did they forget to build you with\ncommon sense?
0x06B6EBDC=What should I do, then?
0x06B6EC68=Well, you know him better than me.
0x06B6EC8C=Yeah...
0x06B6EC94=You're my best friend.\nMine and Roxas's. Got it memorized?
0x06B6ECF4=I'm not sure.
0x06B6ED3C=Oh, come on, don't look shocked.\nYou already knew you're a Replica.
0x06B6ED8C=Is he who I think he is?
0x06B6EE00=If he's getting weaker and you're\ngetting stronger...
0x06B6EE8C=A puppet whose original purpose was to\nduplicate Roxas's powers.
0x06B6EEFC=I can't make that decision for you.\nYou're no puppet in my book.
0x06B6EF60=Something's wrong with Roxas.\nI thought you might know what's up.
0x06B6EFA4=Well, that just means you're borrowing\na little more than you oughta be.
0x06B6F034=Ask yourself what's doing it to him.
0x06B6F068=He says the Keyblade wears him out now\nwhen he goes to use it.
0x06B6F11C=I saw a boy today who looks just like\nRoxas.
0x06B6F1A0=What's that?
0x06B6F1B0=Can I ask you one other thing?
0x06B70448=Let Xion take from Roxas the rest of\nwhat he has to give...
0x06B70490=Sora is having a powerful effect on\nher.
0x06B7057C=All three will be operable in a matter of\ndays.
0x06B705AC=Both of them have connections to Sora,\nbut we only need one of them under our\nthumb.
0x06B70604=But in the end, it only proves the\npuppet is the more worthy vessel.
0x06B706F8=What do you want to do with Roxas?
0x06B7072C=At last, the time has come.\nSaïx, are the devices ready?
0x06B7081C=Or, let him destroy her first and get it\nall back. It makes no difference to me.
0x06B708A8=Good.
0x06B708B0=Yes, it was not supposed to gain a\nmind of its own―nor become the person\nwe see.
0x06B70904=Either way, Sora's power will be ours.
0x06B71228=I'm going to wreck everything...
0x06B7124C=What's the right thing to do?\nRiku would know...
0x06B71E74=I have to make the most of the time\nhe's given me.
0x06B71EF8=sarasa
0x06B745D4=Sorry, I gotta go.
0x06B745F4=But...
0x06B74624=Why wouldn't I?
0x06B7464C=Hey, whoa whoa whoa...\nRoxas, you really wanna do that?
0x06B7470C=Good morning.
0x06B7478C=I have an urgent mission especially for\nyou and your Keyblade.
0x06B74808=S...sure...\nLeave it to me!
0x06B74858=Hey, Xion, good morning.
0x06B74874=Roxas.\nHow are you feeling today?
0x06B74898=Yeah, I need to get ready, too.\nLet's catch up later!
0x06B748DC=Shouldn't you already be out on your\nmission, Axel?
0x06B74928=Can't you just let things run their\ncourse?
0x06B74954=Same as always.
0x06B74964=There's a Heartless that's surfaced in\nHalloween Town. I was hoping you might\nexterminate it for us.
0x06B74A18=Listen―
0x06B74AD0=It's just, lately you―
0x06B77788=They would do that?
0x06B77818=Me and Xion? But...
0x06B7782C=Roxas?\nWh...what are you doing here?
0x06B7787C=I've gotta finish this now, before it\nwears me down any further.
0x06B778C0=This mission was a setup.
0x06B77904=It's all or nothing...
0x06B7794C=Xion!?
0x06B77990=The Heartless I was fighting―it was\nyou?
0x06B779D0=It was rigged so you two would battle\neach other.
0x06B77A04=It's...it's too powerful.
0x06B77B08=What?
0x06B77B48=STOP, both of you!
0x06B7AA4C=Heh, beats me.
0x06B7AA88=Been a while since we all hung out like\nthis, huh?
0x06B7AAD4=Just checking.
0x06B7AAE4=Uhh...n-nothing.\nSo what do you win?
0x06B7AB30=Oh yeah!
0x06B7AB44=We don't have any place to run.
0x06B7AB64=As long as we remember each other...\nright? Don't worry, Axel―we got your\nhokey speech memorized.
0x06B7ABC8=Heh heh heh...
0x06B7AC78=I know.\nHeh, I was just thinking out loud.
0x06B7ACD8=Ha ha, you don't know?
0x06B7ACF0=Hey, wait a second...
0x06B7AD08=Me too. Forever...
0x06B7AD4C=Right.
0x06B7AD54=Well, we have had our share of drama.
0x06B7ADBC=Well, even if things change, we'll never\nbe apart―
0x06B7AED0=I'll have these moments memorized for\na long time. Forever, I hope.
0x06B7AF38=Really? For what?
0x06B7AF4C=What?
0x06B7B094=I know we've seen a lot of sunsets,\nbut today's puts them all to shame.
0x06B7B0DC=Once you finish your ice cream bar,\ncheck the stick. It might say WINNER.
0x06B7B128=It's gotta be something good, if you're\na WINNER!
0x06B7B194=The three of us.\nThen we could always be together.
0x06B7B238=If only things stayed like this.
0x06B7B268=“Oh yeah” what?
0x06B7B27C=Hey, I just remembered―did you guys\nknow you should be checking your ice\ncream sticks?
0x06B7B2D8=What if we all ran off?
0x06B7B370=Wow.\nThe sun sure is beautiful.
0x06B7B390=Brain freeze, ha ha.
0x06B7C86C=Penses-y.
0x06B7C900=We don't need them both. Just one.\nAnd pretending won't change it.
0x06B7C9C8=You've meddled again.
0x06B7C9F0=Think about that.
0x06B7CA20=Sorry, did you say something?
0x06B7EA48=Now here's an unlikely trio.\nMe, Xigbar, and Xion?
0x06B7EB88=They can handle their mission.\nYou hurry up and see to your own.
0x06B7EC08=Worried I'll slow you down?
0x06B7ECA4=No...I didn't―\nNever mind.
0x06B7ECC4=What an extraordinarily childish notion.\nDo you need Axel to walk you\neverywhere now?
0x06B7ED1C=You have your own mission, Roxas.
0x06B7ED64='Course not.\nTouchy, touchy...
0x06B7ED84=I can't trade with Xigbar or something?
0x06B7EDAC=It's just not every day we get to go\nfor a stroll with Number Ⅱ himself.\nAin't that right, Xion?
0x06B7EE28=Hey, you three are teamed up for the\nday?
0x06B7EF58=Yeah.
0x06B830D4=Please, Axel.\nYou have to take care of Roxas.
0x06B83130=Have you flipped your lid?
0x06B8314C=Please!
0x06B83154=Shut up!
0x06B8317C=But how are you...gonna...
0x06B83198=Cut it out, Xion!
0x06B831C4=Please...let me go.\nI have to do this, or else― Look.
0x06B83228=Ha ha!\nTalk about a blast from the past.
0x06B8327C=Pitié, Axel.\nTu dois veiller sur Roxas.
0x06B832A8=What the...
0x06B832CC=Do you always have to stare at me like\nI just drowned your goldfish?
0x06B8334C=Axel, I'm sorry.
0x06B833C8=Of all the faces...\nWhy do I look at her and see yours?
0x06B83514=Thank you.
0x06B86980=And when I looked in the mirror...\nIt wasn't you I saw.
0x06B869B8=Axel, he's kidding, right?
0x06B86A00=Explain yourself, Axel.
0x06B86A18=I'll always be me!\nYour best friend―just like Xion!
0x06B86A9C=What was that all about?
0x06B86AB8=Why can't you understand...
0x06B86AD4=She's smoke and mirrors, Roxas.
0x06B86AF4=Where's Xion?
0x06B86B44=Roxas, you're...you're not seeing the\nbigger picture. Any of it.
0x06B86B94=And now we're left with the one we\ncan't use...
0x06B86C34=It's just like Xigbar said.\nI couldn't stop her from going.
0x06B86C70=Roxas!
0x06B86C90=As if. Your friend sat there sucking\nhis thumb while Xion walked right off.\n...I'm going back to my room.
0x06B86CFC=Don't give me that!\nWhy not?
0x06B86D48=Roxas, if somebody doesn't, you'll...
0x06B86D94=Ugh, forget this.
0x06B86DEC=Have you gone nuts?\nXion's a person, not a puppet.
0x06B86E30=She flew the coop.\nFlamesilocks here couldn't trouble\nhimself to clip her wings.
0x06B86E84=I don't know what you're talking about,\nbut Xion is Xion. You can't expect her\nto be me.
0x06B86EF4=It was only a matter of time before\nsomebody had to break the mirror.
0x06B86F3C=Look, nothing.
0x06B86F4C=What happened out there?
0x06B86F68=What?
0x06B86FA4=I'll give him that.\nCan't toss the blame around when I\ncouldn't stop her either.
0x06B86FF8=The Organization made her to duplicate\nyour powers. She's a puppet.
0x06B87058=Explique-toi, Axel.
0x06B870D0=Roxas...\nXion is like a mirror that reflects you.
0x06B87104=You mean destroy her.
0x06B871CC=You won't be you anymore.
0x06B87264=Answer me!
0x06B87338=Xion's gone!\nHow is that nothing?
0x06B87368=I didn't let her go. The old man needs\nto get his eyes checked. Anyway, she\nwasn't taking no for an answer.
0x06B87400=That's not what I mean, Roxas.
0x06B89778=Naminé?\nWhat's she like?
0x06B89818=Good-bye...
0x06B8987C=Did you find the right answer?
0x06B8989C=Go to Twilight Town.\nYou'll find a girl there by the name of\nNaminé.
0x06B89930=Yeah. I did.
0x06B899E8=All right.\nThanks, Riku.
0x06B89A04=I'm on the verge of losing everything\nI ever cared about. I can't let that\nhappen.
0x06B89AD8=Tell me what I need to do.
0x06B89B00=Riku!
0x06B89B08=You'll find out.\nI don't think you'll have much trouble\ntracking her down.
0x06B8E68C=Do we know where she is?
0x06B8E6FC=Puppets generally don't make\nthemselves.
0x06B8E728=thus making them our own.
0x06B8E790=Seeing as how she escaped on your\nwatch, the onus is on you to capture\nher and return her here.
0x06B8E7F0=That caught us off guard.\nIf anything like that happened before,\nno one at C.O. ever reported it.
0x06B8E854=The Replica Program was one of our\nlittle pet projects.
0x06B8E8C0=Fortunately, the puppet has no means\nof dashing our plans now, even if she\nhas learned to pull her own strings.
0x06B8E930=Puppet?\nSomeone made her?
0x06B8E994=If only the whispers at the top of the\nladder carried to the bottom rung...
0x06B8E9E0=Vexen oversaw the project at Castle\nOblivion.
0x06B8EA1C=“Deserter” is hardly the term for a \nbroken specimen who wandered out\nfrom under the microscope.
0x06B8EA84=I am willing to overlook any nicks or\nscratches. Just ensure she still\nfunctions on arrival.
0x06B8EBF8=And this particular Replica―the one we\ncalled Xion―came to form an identity\nof her own.
0x06B8EC74=Still, she knows our secrets.\nWe need to shorten her leash...\nAnd perhaps tighten it.
0x06B8ECCC=The goal was to duplicate the Keyblade\nwielder's memories, and through them,\nhis powers―
0x06B8EDC4=“It,” not “she.”\nXion is just a Replica...a puppet.
0x06B8EE00=Axel, you have your orders.
0x06B8EE1C=Did they, Axel?
0x06B8EFC0=Still here, Roxas?\nProceed with your mission.
0x06B8F038=All this time, I've been talking to a\npuppet... Intense.
0x06B8F074=Bring her back?\nIt's sheer madness...
0x06B8F1BC=Those orders were absolute.
0x06B8F218=Dismissed.
0x06B8F280=A puppet, one of us?\nDon't be absurd.
0x06B8F2F8=Why you would allow a deserter back\nunder our roof... She should be\neradicated!
0x06B8F408=However, our efforts were severely\nderailed by his unexpected demise.
0x06B8F450=So now we just sweep it all up?\nHeh... As if.
0x06B8F48C=Count the seats.
0x06B8F4AC=When have we ever been more than\nthirteen?
0x06B8F4D8=Xion is one of us.
0x06B8F4EC=You don't mean―
0x06B8F54C=Xion has vanished again.
0x06B8F578=Axel.
0x06B8F5F0=Perhaps you'd care to enlighten us\nabout this “pet project.”
0x06B91B74=Have you got all your strength\nback?
0x06B91BD8=Well...could you at least try not to hurt\nher this time?
0x06B91C14=Axel!
0x06B91C88=I have to, or else I'm not safe here\neither.
0x06B91CB8=Xion is dangerous.
0x06B91CCC=You knew all this time, and kept it from\nme?
0x06B91D08=Dangerous how?
0x06B91D18=How long have you known about her?
0x06B91D3C=I don't think Xion's safe here anymore.
0x06B91DA0=Not yet...
0x06B91DAC=You're not really gonna do what Xemnas\nsays?
0x06B91E30=Roxas...
0x06B91E98=That's up to her.
0x06B92EF0=Everything's a mystery.\nThey didn't even tell me about Xion.
0x06B92F30=Hmph, the biggest mystery is me―\nthe idiot who keeps doing everything\nhe's told.
0x06B92F84=Huff...huff...
0x06B92FD8=Pff... pff...
0x06B93028=What am I doing?\nGetting worked up over some device.
0x06B931BC=Like I've got any clue what the\nOrganization even uses it for...
0x06B95A94=What they did to Sora back there―\nthe point wasn't just to take his\nmemory apart.
0x06B95BA0=Promise me, Mickey.
0x06B95C18=You have to be there for our friends.
0x06B95C7C=Maybe you could do me a favor, though.
0x06B95CF0=And as long as they've got their hands\non Sora's most precious memories―\nthe ones of Kairi―
0x06B95D50=Don't say that, Riku.
0x06B95D68=Gosh, have I been worried about you!\nWhere've you been all this time?
0x06B95DBC=Searching, for a way to conquer the\ndarkness within me―while we wait for\nSora to awaken.
0x06B95E20=Well, then you have to let me help!\nMaybe I could get the memories back!
0x06B95E94=I've got that covered, Your Maj―\nI mean, Mickey.
0x06B95EC8=It's almost like they're trying to buy\nsome time...
0x06B95F30=They went out of their way to make it\nhard to put back together.
0x06B95FB4=the only one who can guide them when\nthey awaken.
0x06B95FFC=Gosh, I guess that explains things.
0x06B96020=I might not survive the fight.\nAnd if I do, it might only be because I\ngave in to the darkness.
0x06B960E4=...which means Naminé isn't the only one\npicking up the pieces.
0x06B961BC=I have to face one of the\nOrganization's members soon.
0x06B9632C=That means you're the only one who\nwill be there for Sora, Donald, and\nGoofy―
0x06B9637C=There's a reason the Organization has\nbeen quiet since our battle at Castle\nOblivion―
0x06B963D4=Your Majesty.
0x06B96468=Sure.\nJust tell me what you need.
0x06B96494=I don't think Sora will recover.
0x06B96588=Exactly.\nThey want Sora's memories...
0x06B965EC=You don't have to worry.\nI'm getting the hang of keeping the\ndarkness under control.
0x06B966D8=Riku?
0x06B96740=and it's not because we weakened their\nnumbers.
0x06B96788=For a second there, you looked just\nlike...well, you know...
0x06B96858=Of course, Riku.\nI promise.
0x06B96874=That's great to hear.\nBut, you said that Sora hasn't woken up\nyet... Did something go wrong?
0x06B99924=No, you've got that part wrong.\nYou'll always be my best friend.
0x06B999F4=I'm special, like Xion.\nI know that.
0x06B99A40=You've just gotta trust me, Roxas.
0x06B99A64=But the Organization wanted me out of\nthe picture.
0x06B99A98=I deserve those answers!
0x06B99B08=Is it because Xion copied my Keyblade\nand they didn't need me anymore?
0x06B99BE8=No...
0x06B99C1C=Axel...\nWho am I, really?
0x06B99CEC=Where did I learn to use the Keyblade?
0x06B99D34=Didn't get it memorized, huh?
0x06B99D64=Hey, c'mon...
0x06B99DDC=I don't.
0x06B99DE8=Like it's gonna be that easy.
0x06B99E2C=That'll be the person I trust.
0x06B99E6C=Who am I, Axel?
0x06B99E7C=Why am I special?
0x06B99E90=Xemnas said me and Xion are connected\nto Sora. Who is that?
0x06B99EF4=Not the whole time.
0x06B99F48=Tell me!
0x06B99F54=You find Xion?
0x06B99FDC=Somebody knows where I came from.
0x06B9A000=Yeah... They did.
0x06B9A020=Am I a puppet like Xion?
0x06B9A03C=And you feel the same way.
0x06B9A058=Best friends are honest with each\nother!
0x06B9A084=Hey, Roxas.
0x06B9A090=What makes you so sure?\nI have a right to know who I am!
0x06B9A0CC=When did you find out?
0x06B9A0F0=Roxas...
0x06B9A0FC=Oh, I dunno.\nSomewhere along the way.
0x06B9A16C=If I can't get answers here, I'll get\nthem somewhere else.
0x06B9A1A8=Have you been keeping the truth about\nher from me this whole time?
0x06B9A22C=What, then?
0x06B9A238=Are you gonna tell me or not?
0x06B9A258=Axel... Who am I?
0x06B9A288=How did I get here?
0x06B9A358=Axel.
0x06B9A360=I know...
0x06B9A3BC=You really think the truth is going to\nmake you feel better? It won't.
0x06B9BA08=That's not true...
0x06B9BA50=No one would miss me.
0x06B9BAB8=You can't turn on the Organization!\nYou get on their bad side and they'll\ndestroy you!
0x06B9BB1C=I would.
0x06B9BBC4=Why did the Keyblade choose me?\nI have to know.
0x06B9BBF4=Your mind's made up?
0x06B9E4A8=I can't save you, Xion―even a memory\nof you.
0x06B9E588=It's just...there isn't anything else I\ncan do for him.
0x06B9E690=Thank you...
0x06B9E6A0=That blasted puppet led them right to\nour doorstep! See what you get for\ntrusting it?
0x06B9E6F8=Back to Sora?
0x06B9E714=What do you think I should do?
0x06B9E734=You won't be alone. I asked somebody\nelse to look after him, too.
0x06B9E778=He can't feel Sora.\nBut he will.
0x06B9E79C=Roxas belongs with Sora, too.
0x06B9E7D4=And since everything about you was\nbuilt on those memories...
0x06B9E84C=I thought I knew at first.\nI wanted me and Roxas and Axel to be\ntogether forever.
0x06B9E8D0=The more I remember, the more I feel\nlike I'm in the wrong place...like...
0x06B9E91C=...no one will remember you when\nyou're gone. There won't be any “you”\nto remember.
0x06B9E984=Like I need to go back.
0x06B9E9CC=But...I don't think he would understand.\nNot yet.
0x06B9EA68=But then I started to realize these\nmemories don't belong to me.
0x06B9EB18=If you return your memories to him,\nyou'll disappear.
0x06B9EBA0=Yes.
0x06B9EBB4=I know. I'm ready.\nOtherwise I wouldn't be here.
0x06B9EC08=That's because you're Kairi.\nAt least, the Kairi Sora remembers.
0x06B9ED24=No! Xion...
0x06B9EDB8=All right.
0x06B9EE8C=Naminé, will you watch over Roxas once\nI'm gone?
0x06B9EEC0=Naminé, you can see my face?
0x06B9EEE0=What do you want to do?
0x06B9EF00=If you're ready, let's go see Sora.
0x06B9EF5C=Naminé, they've found us!\nThey are on their way!
0x06B9EF90=I'll get rid of them!
0x06B9FDFC=We don't accept resignations.
0x06B9FEB4=Then let's keep this short and sweet.
0x06B9FEF0=I've got nothing to say to you.
0x06BA123C=Nngh...\nHow much longer...
0x06BA12A4=Kingdom...Hearts...
0x06BA12C0=Will your strength never be mine?
0x06BA1304=Kingdom... Hearts...
0x06BA24C8=Man...\nWhy you always gotta...cause me...\ntrouble...
0x06BA34EC=It is probably for the best.
0x06BA3518=Get me back my Keyblade wielder.\nFetch me Roxas.
0x06BA354C=Xion is no more.
0x06BA6A80=Shut up!
0x06BA6A8C=Because I want back the rest of Sora's\nmemories.
0x06BA6AD0=Do you have some kind of plan?
0x06BA6B38=If you try and make contact with\nKingdom Hearts, the last thing you'll\nget is your life back.
0x06BA6BAC=Me, and Axel, and...and her can go on\nhaving ice cream together...
0x06BA6C30=The Organization will destroy you.
0x06BA6C74=Her? You mean Xion?\nIt's a struggle just to remember the\nname now, isn't it?
0x06BA6CC4=I want Xion back.\nI want my life back!
0x06BA6D24=Sora, Sora, Sora!\nEnough about Sora!
0x06BA6D58=Either way, I can't let you go doing\nanything crazy.
0x06BA6D90=Who are you?
0x06BA6DCC=I have to find this Sora person, and\nfreeing Kingdom Hearts is the only way!
0x06BA6F08=What does it matter?\nI'm here for you.
0x06BA6F8C=I'm going to set Kingdom Hearts free!\nThen everything can go back to the\nway it was!
0x06BA7048=Why are you trying to stop me?
0x06BB02E4=I should go talk to her once I finish up\nhere.
0x06BB03BC=Xion looked really upset when she left\nthis morning. I wonder what's on her\nmind...
0x06BB1014=No sign of the Heartless here...
0x06BB1094=Guess I'll check further in.
0x06BB1FEC=Still no Heartless.\nWhere is this thing hiding, anyway?
0x06BB2044=Wh-what!? How could it get this close\nwithout me noticing?
0x06BB30C8=And when she left us, Axel helped her.\nLike he wanted her to go.
0x06BB3144=If he knew, why did he wait so long to\ntell me?
0x06BB31CC=It's all just too much...
0x06BB3228=Xion and I are both special Nobodies.\nWhat if they made me, too?
0x06BB32D8=Is it because I'm the same thing?
0x06BB3304=But who's Sora?
0x06BB3314=I'll bet he's been sitting on all kinds of\nsecrets this whole time.
0x06BB3360=Axel knows.
0x06BB3454=And who am I to him?
0x06BB346C=He doesn't even have the guts to tell\nme the truth about me...
0x06BB34AC=Xemnas said...Sora was what connects\nher and me.
0x06BB34E0=Xion was part of that Replica Program.\nMade to copy my Keyblade...
0x06BB45CC=...there's nothing left for me here.
0x06BB4634=The answers are out there.
0x06BB46EC=I tried, but...
0x06BB4960=I knew that I'd find you snoozing down here.
0x06BB621C=Come see me when you are ready.
0x06BB623C=Roxas, today you will be working with\nMarluxia.
0x06BB626C=Well, there you have it.\nWelcome to the fold, Roxas.
0x06BB7010=I shall be joining you on your mission\ntoday.
0x06BB7084=Good morning, Roxas.
0x06BB70C8=Take care of what you need to and then\ncheck in with Saïx. I am all ready to go.
0x06BB8264=Roxas, I have decided to pair you with\nLexaeus for your mission today.
0x06BB837C=Come see me when you're ready.
0x06BB9890=Magic? I know magic?
0x06BB98D8=She already left.\nMeet her on-site.
0x06BB9A18=Larxene...right.\nUm...
0x06BB9A30=Only if you arm yourself with some\nbefore you leave for the mission.\nSee me when you are ready.
0x06BB9A90=This time, we expect you to try out\nmagic for a change, instead of relying\nsolely on the Keyblade.
0x06BB9AFC=Roxas.\nLarxene will be your partner today.
0x06BB9B48=Oh...\nAll right.
0x06BBAA30=Report to Saïx when you're ready.
0x06BBAA78=You're mine today, Roxas.
0x06BBAB38=Euh, OK...
0x06BBAB44=Uh, all right...
0x06BBB934=Greetings, kupo.\nWhat...is your name?
0x06BBB9B8=My name is of no importance, kupo.
0x06BBB9F4=But... Hrm.
0x06BBBAC8=Roxas. What's yours?
0x06BBBAE0=Are you here to shop, kupo?\nHave a look, kupo, at my wondrous\nwares.
0x06BBBB28=Okay, let's see what you've got.
0x06BBCF18=Oh, and if you want to practice what\nyou've learned so far, we've got the\nHolo-Missions all set up for you.
0x06BBCFB8=Oh, by the way, Roxas, today will be\nyour first really-real mission.
0x06BBD000=Okay.
0x06BBD0A4=I don't know what they've cooked up\nfor us, but let's get it done with style,\nhuh?
0x06BBD18C=Yup. Basically, they're a way to\nre-experience missions you've already\nbeen assigned.
0x06BBD228=Holo-Missions?
0x06BBD264=Check in with Saïx when―\nWell, you know the drill.
0x06BBD2BC=Hey, Roxas.
0x06BBD320=Right.
0x06BBD340=It's you and me again today.
0x06BBD360=That means you should definitely prep\nyour weapon beforehand.
0x06BBEC38=move
0x06BC3A9C=Our second mission together.
0x06BC3ABC=What?\nOh...oh, yeah.
0x06BC3B04=Yup.
0x06BC3B90=Sheesh, don't talk my ear off.\n...You ready or what?
0x06BC5670=What was today's target again?\nA Guardian?
0x06BC56A4=You are such a zombie.\nWant me to go have all the fun while\nyou figure it out? C'mon.
0x06BC575C=Huh?\nOh, yeah. I think so.
0x06BC5778=Okay, let's get this done fast.
0x06BC6280=Up this way, Roxas.
0x06BC62BC=Right.
0x06BC8698=Right!
0x06BC8708=There's our target.
0x06BC8778=Here we go, Roxas!\nKeep your head out of the clouds!
0x06BCA200=Yeah.
0x06BCA224=Heh, gotta say, man, you've come a\nlong way in just a handful of days.
0x06BCA274=Mission accomplie.
0x06BCA2A4=You ready to head back?
0x06BCA310=Mission accomplished.
0x06BCE19C=You ready for this?
0x06BCE1D0=Yeah.
0x06BCE240=What is THAT?
0x06BCE338=Our target!
0x06BD2218=Right.
0x06BD2278=Well, the mission in question was to\ntake out a giant Heartless.
0x06BD2334=That could be anywhere.
0x06BD234C=Where do you suppose Xion is?
0x06BD2378=Let's start by digging up info around\ntown.
0x06BD23D0=If we can find that Heartless, there's\na good chance we'll find Xion, too.
0x06BD4680=And you heard it where again?
0x06BD46A0=Could be our Heartless.
0x06BD4714=I'm sure Xion is just fine.\nC'mon, let's go check it out.
0x06BD4750=You sure you heard that right?
0x06BD4778=Are you kidding? I was scared!\nI got out of there as fast as I could.
0x06BD486C=The tunnel! I was just there, and I\nheard a weird, low moan.
0x06BD4914=Did ya see what was making it?
0x06BD4950=Yes, I'm sure. I told you!
0x06BD4A34=A low moan?
0x06BD4A40=Or it could be Xion―injured, unable to\nmake it back to the castle...
0x06BD7B9C=Oh! Are you talking about that vent\nup there?
0x06BD7C1C=Strange moaning...
0x06BD7C30=Sure. I'll catch you later.
0x06BD7C4C=Um, thanks.
0x06BD7CDC=No Heartless, either.
0x06BD7D4C=Hey, I don't think we've been\nintroduced.
0x06BD7DE8=We heard rumors of a strange moaning\nsound?
0x06BD7EDC=The wind coming through it creates a\nlot of echoes. It sounds kind of like a\nmoan.
0x06BD7F30=You lose something?
0x06BD7F7C=Oh, I'm sorry.\nHope you find them soon.
0x06BD7FF4=Time to hit the town again...
0x06BD8014=Yeah, all we really learned was that\nguy's name.
0x06BD8050=Well, that was a dead end.
0x06BD8078=Huh?\nWhat are you guys doing down here?
0x06BD80A0=Me?\nHeh heh, that's a secret.
0x06BD8120=Thanks.
0x06BD8160=So...you guys said you lost something?
0x06BD81D0=No Xion...
0x06BD81DC=You could say that, yeah.
0x06BD821C=So what's your story?\nWhy are you down here?
0x06BD8258=I'm Pence.\nIf you ever need anything, I'm always\nhappy to help.
0x06BD8298=Some-ONE.\nA friend of ours.
0x06BD82B4=What?\nUgh, for crying out loud...
0x06BD9B58=He's been acting pretty dodgy lately―\nall this sneaking around? I wonder\nwhat he's up to.
0x06BD9BB4=Beats me.
0x06BD9C90=Olette, what's Pence up to?
0x06BD9CD4=Hmm, now why would he do that?
0x06BD9D4C=Guess we'll have to hunt around.
0x06BD9D70=He freaked out when I swung by the\nusual spot yesterday. Whatever he was\nlooking at, he hid it in a hurry.
0x06BD9E7C=He said he was off on another of his\n“investigations” today.
0x06BD9EC0=I wonder where their “usual spot” is.
0x06BDB3D4=Somebody's scribbled some notes on it.
0x06BDB43C=I think we know just the guy to ask.\nIf nothing else, he seemed to know a\nlot about the town.
0x06BDB524=Hey, I found a piece of paper.
0x06BDB5CC=It's some kind of map.
0x06BDB5E4=There's more. “The Doppelganger”...\n“The Animated Bag”...
0x06BDB628=“Spooky Steps”?\n“Friend from Beyond the Wall”?\nHey, this one about a moaning tunnel...
0x06BDB68C=A ghost train, a haunted mansion...\nThere's seven altogether.
0x06BDB77C=What's it all mean?
0x06BDB808=Sounds familiar, huh?
0x06BDCBC4=All right.\nI'll tell you what I've got so far.
0x06BDCC48=Hey, guys.\nSomething I can help you with?
0x06BDCC74=I mean, there are lots of little quirks\nand mysteries, right? Like, say...the\nSpooky Stairs...
0x06BDCD84=Uh, yeah, something like that.
0x06BDCDA4=What?
0x06BDCDAC=Yeah, actually.\nWe had a question.
0x06BDCDEC=That is, IF you can answer the\nfollowing questions!
0x06BDCE88=Hmm...
0x06BDCE90=They're about the town.\nI want to see how serious you are\nabout investigating this place.
0x06BDCF40=Okay, shoot.\nLet's see if it's anything I know.
0x06BDCFF4=Is anything...weird happening here?\nYou know, in the town.
0x06BDD030=So you guys are like me, investigating\nthe town's Seven Wonders?
0x06BDD080=I wasn't planning to talk to anyone\nabout it until I'd finished up my\ninvestigation, but...
0x06BDD128=Ohhh...
0x06BDDED0=c. The Struggle draws near
0x06BDDF48=c. Station Plaza
0x06BDDF74=What's at the top of Station Heights?
0x06BDDFB4=b. Scoop up some sea-salt ice cream
0x06BDE004=What's written on the bulletin board in Station Heights?
0x06BDE040=a. Three cars
0x06BDE068=b. Two cars
0x06BDE074=c. Just one car
0x06BDE098=How many cars are in the train you can see from\nStation Plaza?
0x06BDE0D8=a. Apartments available
0x06BDE128=a. Tram Common
0x06BDE198=b. The sandlot
0x06BDE1B4=a. Appartements libres
0x06BDEAF8=Just say the word if you want to go\nanother round.
0x06BDEBC0=Ooh, sorry! That's not right.\nIt's not too hard to go check, though.\nI'll be waiting here.
0x06BDF4AC=Is it quiz time?\nAll right, let's go!
0x06BE15B4=He said people have been feeling some\nkind of presence in the woods outside\nof town, right?
0x06BE1624=Huh?
0x06BE162C=Maybe, maybe not.
0x06BE1640=...Weird, huh? I still haven't seen it\nfirsthand, so I can't tell you much.
0x06BE171C=Good luck with that.
0x06BE1734=Like those stairs you mentioned?\nTotal sham. The truth about that one is\njust embarrassing.
0x06BE17B0=Sorry, guys. You're wasting your time.\nWell, except maybe for the Eighth\nWonder...
0x06BE1804=That was uninformative.
0x06BE188C=Right...\nLet's go check it out.
0x06BE18AC=There's an Eighth!?
0x06BE19AC=The one about the tree.\nOut in the woods?
0x06BE1B10=Pretty strange.
0x06BE1B3C=In...the sense that they're all made-up.\nNothing but stupid urban legends and\nrumors.
0x06BE1B94=Wouldn't be much of a Wonder if it\nwasn't! I'm planning to go figure out\nthe trick behind it later.
0x06BE1C00=But people have said they feel like\nthey're being watched there―even\nthough it's deserted.
0x06BE1CF0=Correct!\nAll right, a promise is a promise.\nI'll tell you what I know.
0x06BE1D44=What?
0x06BE1D4C=Ah, OK.
0x06BE1D70=Maybe that's Xion's target.
0x06BE1D8C=There's one tree where, if you shake it,\nthe whole place starts to rustle.\nSwish, swish, SWISH!
0x06BE1DEC=So, I've been digging around, and I've\nlearned that the town's Wonders are\nall linked!
0x06BE1E7C=Just another sleepy town, huh?
0x06BE1F74=Thanks! Well, I should get back to my\ninvestigation. Try to keep this to\nyourselves, yeah?
0x06BE3A84=Hurry, Roxas.\nDon't let it get away!
0x06BE3AAC=Right!
0x06BE3AD4=Heh, looks like we got a live one here.
0x06BE3B78=Is...is something there?
0x06BE5908=What do you suggest?
0x06BE59D0=Here we go!
0x06BE59E8=Still out trying to find it, probably.
0x06BE5A48=Right.
0x06BE5A50=So, where is Xion?
0x06BE5A98=No wonder Xion had trouble.\nIt was blending right into the scenery.
0x06BE5B2C=Well, a target's a target. Doesn't\nmatter who takes it out. I say we do it\nnow, before it vanishes again.
0x06BE5BC0=You think that's the one?
0x06BEA378=And I'm Pence.\nBut you already knew that.
0x06BEA3A4=Hey! Hayner, don't be rude!\nThere's no need to be mean.
0x06BEA418=Grandstander?
0x06BEA428=Nice to...meet you, too.
0x06BEA518=Friend of yours, Pence?
0x06BEA58C=Here.
0x06BEA5E8=What are you all doing?
0x06BEA600=Yeah, you keep hitting a ball in the air\nand try to keep it from touching the\nground.
0x06BEA678=How's it going?
0x06BEA688=Oh. Well, it's nice to meet you.\nI'm Olette.
0x06BEA6B8=On your own today?\nOh, did you find your friend?
0x06BEA6EC=What will that prove?
0x06BEA710=Hey―you try it.\nLet's see your juggling act.
0x06BEA770=You new around here?\nHow come you're bothering us?
0x06BEA7F0=Huh? Pence, who's...
0x06BEA808=Keep it up!
0x06BEA834=Ugh, now I'm all tired.
0x06BEA864=Huh? Oh, yeah.
0x06BEA894=That was amazing, Hayner!\nA new record, for sure!
0x06BEA8C8=Augh! No more!\nHuff, huff... I'm done.
0x06BEA8F0=Hayner's one of the best in town.
0x06BEA93C=Uh-huh.\nWell, keep passing by then.\nWe're busy here.
0x06BEAA58=Tiens.
0x06BEAAC8=Watching Hayner here practice his\nGrandstander act.
0x06BEAB80=It's not gonna kill him.
0x06BEAB9C=Sorry about that. I'm sure he didn't\nmean to offend you. He's just―
0x06BEABFC=Hey, I know you.
0x06BEACDC=Hey.
0x06BEACF4=Woo-hoo! Go, Hayner!
0x06BEAD18=Bothering? I'm not―\nSheesh, I was just passing by.
0x06BEAD50=Yeah, I bumped into him a little while\nback.
0x06BEBB0C=Me either! That was amazing!
0x06BEBB60=Wow! Just...just wow!\nI've never seen anybody Grandstand\nlike that!
0x06BEC79C=Wow, you're good!
0x06BEC7B0=Yeah, you'd give Hayner a run for his\nmoney!
0x06BED330=Not bad at all.
0x06BED378=Better than most!
0x06BEE0A0=Ha ha, don't worry about it.\nIt was your first time.
0x06BEE16C=And it really IS hard.
0x06BEEBAC=Nein
0x06BEEC0C=Hrm...
0x06BEEC48=Well? Whaddaya say?
0x06BEEC7C=Try it again, man.\nC'mon, just one more time.
0x06BF08E8=Uh...thanks?
0x06BF08F8=Bye for now! Hope we can practice\nGrandstander again soon!
0x06BF097C=No, I do. I should go.
0x06BF0994=So, you said you were passing by.\nDoes that mean you have to head off\nsoon? Because if not―
0x06BF0A1C=Heh heh.
0x06BF0A7C=Hey! That's enough from the peanut\ngallery!
0x06BF0AB8=Oh great, now even the new guy is\nlaughing at me.
0x06BF0BBC=That includes you!
0x06BF0BD0=Yeah.\nAnyway, we'll see you later.
0x06BF0C00=All right. Sorry for holding you up.\nWe should get going too.
0x06BF0CA8=Sorry for railing on you before.
0x06BF0D20=Hayner was only acting all grumpy\nbecause Seifer beat his record.
0x06BF0D64=Hi, hi, hi...
0x06BF0D80=Hee hee...
0x06BF0D8C=I guess you're all right.\nWe're cool, man.
0x06BF1970=Hey, isn't that...
0x06BF3E34=Just remember it's still a mission.\nWe're not on a field trip, guys.
0x06BF3E7C=Yeah, I think this is my first three-man\nmission.
0x06BF3F80=This should be fun, huh?\nTripling up like this.
0x06BF3FBC=Just don't push it, you hear me?\nWe'll pick up the slack.
0x06BF4044=I hear you.\nThanks.
0x06BF40A8=Yeah, yeah.\nIt sure is nice to be back on my feet.
0x06BF65FC=Wait!
0x06BF7F88=Wait!
0x06BF7F90=Why didn't she try to get away from\nhim?
0x06BF802C=But...who was the guy with her?
0x06BF8060=Huh? Hey!
0x06BF806C=I know that was Xion I saw yesterday.
0x06BF8F5C=Just me and the Heartless today.
0x06BF8F80=Well...better get it done.
0x06BF9A94=I wonder if Xion and the others are\nback yet.
0x06BFB2F4=Ralentis, Hayner...
0x06BFB354=Slow down, Hayner...
0x06BFB38C=Maybe I'll stop by the clock tower.\nSeems as good a place as any...
0x06BFB3D0=Pence! Olette!\nWhat's the matter?
0x06BFB450=I guess...not all friendships fall apart.
0x06BFB530=If you don't want to shell out,\nI suggest you get running!
0x06BFB590=What!? Not this again!
0x06BFB5A8=You know the rules!\nLast one there buys ice cream!
0x06BFCA58=Ahem. Missions are...uhh...\nThey're, you know... Hrm.
0x06BFCABC=Follow me.
0x06BFCAC8=You know what? Talking is dumb.\nLet's just go ahead and get our hands\ndirty, shall we?
0x06BFCB34=All right, let's start by talking about\nwhat we do on missions.
0x06BFDC04=Follow me.
0x06BFDC20=All right, let's start by talking about\nwhat we do on missions.
0x06BFEB28=A barricade. It means you're not\nsupposed to go this way.
0x06BFEB70=That, or out of trouble.\nI mean, hello, look at it. Big, menacing\nX? I'll take the beaten path, thanks.
0x06BFEC30=Axel... What's this?
0x06BFECFC=Yeah, that's the gist of it.\nThey're set up to keep us on task.
0x06BFED3C=You mean there's nothing down there?
0x06BFFC88=But don't go thinking you can just run\nand jump your way through every\nmission.
0x06BFFCD8=There ya go.\nGood job.
0x06BFFDB4=Y...yeah, I think so.
0x06BFFE08=Thanks.
0x06BFFE40=There's a treasure chest somewhere in\nthese passages. I want you to find it.
0x06BFFF14=All right, then, time for a road test.
0x06BFFF64=I know, don't hurt yourself.\nAnyway, remember to look around.
0x06C00018=What...what do you mean?
0x06C00034=You hafta look around. Sometimes what\nyou're after is sitting right under your\nnose. Got it memorized?
0x06C000C4=That's all I have to do?
0x06C000E0=You've gotta BE AWARE.
0x06C012F4=Is this the chest?
0x06C01308=The mission was to find the chest.\nAren't I done?
0x06C0133C=Yes, that is generally what we do.
0x06C01374=So I should open the chest?
0x06C013D0=Uh, Roxas... There's this thing about\nchests. They have stuff in them.
0x06C014D8=Sure is! Well done.
0x06C014EC=Um, what are you waiting for?
0x06C020B0=RTC?
0x06C020B8=Return To the Castle.\nGo ahead, lead the way back to the\ndark corridor that brought us here.
0x06C02124=Good work! You can keep what you\nfound. All right, time to RTC.
0x06C04448=So, Roxas, shall we put that power of\nyours to a little test?
0x06C04490=Hmph.\nNothing to be feared.
0x06C0450C=Well...sure, all right.
0x06C04564=Okay.\nSo what do I have to do today?
0x06C0458C=Um, how do I do that?
0x06C04730=Lucky Number ⅧⅢ...\nAt last, a chosen wielder of the\nKeyblade amongst our ranks.
0x06C047D0=Roxas, could you summon your Keyblade\nfor me?
0x06C04800=Roxas, was it?\nI never properly introduced myself.
0x06C04834=Use your Keyblade...and defeat those\nHeartless.
0x06C04890=Whoa, what are those?
0x06C048A8=Today, your job is to collect hearts.
0x06C048E8=I am Marluxia, Number ⅧⅠ.
0x06C05E48=Lucky Number ⅧⅢ...\nAt last, a chosen wielder of the\nKeyblade amongst our ranks.
0x06C05EE8=Roxas, was it?\nI never properly introduced myself.
0x06C05F1C=So, Roxas, shall we put that power of\nyours to a little test?
0x06C05FB4=Hmph.\nNothing to be feared.
0x06C0601C=I am Marluxia, Number ⅧⅠ.
0x06C060D8=Okay.\nSo what do I have to do today?
0x06C07DB0=In other words, don't bother with them.\nYour mission is to collect hearts, after\nall.
0x06C07E10=Dark creatures who roam about,\nsearching for hearts. They come in two\nlarger varieties.
0x06C07E68=Good.\nThose Heartless are called Shadows.
0x06C07E94=Hmph... Is right over there.
0x06C07F18=Purebloods don't release any hearts\nwhen you defeat them.
0x06C07FCC=But what are Heartless?
0x06C08008=The ones you just defeated are known\nas Purebloods.
0x06C080AC=The other variety―
0x06C080D8=Forget about the Shadows.
0x06C081C4=Take these out, Roxas.\nThey are your real targets.
0x06C08D24=Right...
0x06C08D34=Those were what we call Emblem\nHeartless.
0x06C08DAC=Did you notice? Hearts appeared when\nyou defeated them.
0x06C08E54=Your job is to collect those hearts.
0x06C08EC8=Why are they so special?
0x06C0BA60=Actually, you are the first of us to\naccomplish it.
0x06C0BA94=Which is...good, right?
0x06C0BAF4=So that's what the Organization does?\nCollect hearts?
0x06C0BC80=Hmm...
0x06C0BCCC=Is there any trick to it?
0x06C0BCE8=Wait, then―
0x06C0BD08=And to do that, we need all the hearts\nwe can possibly find.
0x06C0BDE8=They will gather as one, and create an\nalmighty force known as Kingdom\nHearts.
0x06C0BE4C=Eventually, the hearts will turn right\nback into Heartless.
0x06C0BF40=Completing Kingdom Hearts is the\nOrganization's primary objective.
0x06C0BF84=Heh. Here come more of them.\nEach one is a gift, Roxas. Squeeze\nevery last heart out of them!
0x06C0BFE4=I see. And what happens to the hearts\nI collect?
0x06C0C018=With power like yours―
0x06C0C050=You see, then, how special you are?
0x06C0C074=None. So long as the Heartless are\nfelled by your weapon, the Keyblade,\nthe hearts will be captured.
0x06C0C0DC=The rest of us can defeat Heartless,\nbut we have no way of collecting the\nhearts they release.
0x06C0D2B0=Excellent, Roxas.\nYour work today is done.
0x06C0D310=I am amazed.
0x06C0D350=I have high hopes for you, Roxas―\nas do we all.
0x06C0D384=That Keyblade... The things that could\nbe done with that sort of power...
0x06C0D440=Defeat the Heartless, and help the\nOrganization reach our noble goal.
0x06C0D488=Shall we RTC, then?
0x06C0D500=Um, all right...
0x06C0D540=Umm...
0x06C0EA38=So, even if I'm given another job, I\nshould keep taking out Heartless while\nI do it?
0x06C0EB08=Your mission today is to eliminate a set\nquantity of Heartless.
0x06C0EBFC=But regardless of the task you have\nbeen given, your primary orders still\nhold.
0x06C0EC4C=The Organization may call upon you to\nmeet other objectives―perform recon,\nfor example.
0x06C0ECBC=Correct. Today, however, the two\nhappily coincide.
0x06C0ED34=You and that Keyblade of yours serve\nus best by collecting hearts.
0x06C0FBC8=Correct. Today, however, the two\nhappily coincide.
0x06C0FBFC=You and that Keyblade of yours serve\nus best by collecting hearts.
0x06C0FD70=Your mission today is to eliminate a set\nquantity of Heartless.
0x06C0FE4C=But regardless of the task you have\nbeen given, your primary orders still\nhold.
0x06C0FE9C=The Organization may call upon you to\nmeet other objectives―perform recon,\nfor example.
0x06C115D8=As you can plainly see, there are still\nHeartless wandering about.
0x06C1171C=You don't have to eliminate them all.\nIt's your choice.
0x06C11788=Leave, already? I, for one, would apply\nmyself a bit more.
0x06C117F8=Just like I don't have to respect you\nfor slinking back to the castle while\nthere's still work to be done.
0x06C11864=Now we get to RTC, right?
0x06C11898=Yes, yes, you did as you were asked.\nMission accomplished...but...
0x06C118F0=All done. I defeated the number of\nHeartless you said.
0x06C11990=And if that doesn't matter to you,\njust remember the Organization rewards\nthose who make the extra effort.
0x06C119FC=But I―
0x06C126A0=I trust you'll exhibit equal diligence in\nyour missions going forward.
0x06C12794=Much better.
0x06C146BC=Let's see you use your Limit Break and\ndefeat that Heartless.
0x06C14704=A Heartless.
0x06C14714=Huh?
0x06C14794=So, um―
0x06C147C8=It is the most powerful move at your\ndisposal―one that only works when\nyou are on your last legs.
0x06C148B4=Time for some practical application.
0x06C14920=Do you know what a Limit Break is?
0x06C149BC=No...
0x06C149E8=There.\nNow you're on your last legs.
0x06C1597C=Do you know what a Limit Break is?
0x06C15A18=No...
0x06C15A20=So, um―
0x06C15A60=It is the most powerful move at your\ndisposal―one that only works when\nyou are on your last legs.
0x06C16D88=Let's see you use your Limit Break and\ndefeat that Heartless.
0x06C16DEC=A Heartless.
0x06C16DFC=Huh?
0x06C16EB4=There.\nNow you're on your last legs.
0x06C16F60=Time for some practical application.
0x06C187D4=And I have to face them if we're gonna\ncomplete Kingdom Hearts, right?
0x06C1881C=Right...
0x06C18828=The only person you can count on out\nhere is yourself.
0x06C188D0=So you need me.
0x06C188E0=Yeah?
0x06C188E8=Good for the Organization.
0x06C18904=I don't understand...
0x06C18930=We should return.
0x06C18944=What good does that do us?
0x06C18998=So I've noticed. Nngh...
0x06C189FC=Well fought.
0x06C18A10=Are they good deeds?
0x06C18A28=Organization members are often asked\nto conduct solo missions.
0x06C18A80=Correct.
0x06C18B70=With your job, however, comes risk.\nEach mission will pit you against more\nand more Heartless.
0x06C18BF8=So what happens when Kingdom Hearts\nis finished?
0x06C18C2C=When the time comes, you will.
0x06C18D48=You and that Keyblade are invaluable\nto the Organization.
0x06C18D84=Beau combat.
0x06C18DE0=In the meantime, there are deeds to be\ndone, and only you can do them.
0x06C18E74=Yes.
0x06C18EE0=We will unite with it.\nYou and I will gain hearts of our own.
0x06C1B51C=Yeah, but...
0x06C1B5B0=(Uh-oh.)
0x06C1B6CC=What? Why!?
0x06C1B6DC=...Oh ho!\nI just got an idea.
0x06C1B77C=Well, sink or swim.
0x06C1B790=You can do today's mission WITHOUT\nyour Keyblade.
0x06C1B7D0=I'll stand here and watch.
0x06C1B7EC=No...
0x06C1B874=Let Demyx handle this stuff.\nIt's not like he's good at anything else.
0x06C1B8BC=Pfft, you'd be nothing without that\nKeyblade.
0x06C1B8F8=Because I said so, that's why!\nSaïx told you to practice magic today,\ndidn't he?
0x06C1B958=Well, you're not gonna learn if you keep\nwhipping around that oversized key.
0x06C1B9A8=What? WHAT?\nYou got something to say?
0x06C1B9DC=(Oh oh...)
0x06C1B9E8=(Thanks...)
0x06C1BA14=Umm, hi.
0x06C1BA20=Yeah―sink!\nI don't know how to use magic.
0x06C1BA50=Ah, perfect.\nThere's a Heartless.
0x06C1BA74=Go on, take it out―and you have to use\nmagic!
0x06C1BB40=Whose idea was it to send me along on\nyour stupid baby mission? Do I look like\nI run a nursery school?
0x06C1BBB4=Nice of you to show up.
0x06C1BBCC=Ugh, this is the worst.
0x06C1D3B8=Yeah, but...
0x06C1D3C8=Because I said so, that's why!\nSaïx told you to practice magic today,\ndidn't he?
0x06C1D4AC=Well, you're not gonna learn if you keep\nwhipping around that oversized key.
0x06C1D4FC=What? WHAT?\nYou got something to say?
0x06C1D5AC=What? Why!?
0x06C1D5D4=...Oh ho!\nI just got an idea.
0x06C1D6BC=Whose idea was it to send me along on\nyour stupid baby mission? Do I look like\nI run a nursery school?
0x06C1D724=You can do today's mission WITHOUT\nyour Keyblade.
0x06C1D770=No...
0x06C1D7A4=Ugh, this is the worst.
0x06C1D800=Let Demyx handle this stuff.\nIt's not like he's good at anything else.
0x06C1D848=Pfft, you'd be nothing without that\nKeyblade.
0x06C1E8E8=Ah, perfect.\nThere's a Heartless.
0x06C1E948=Go on, take it out―and you have to use\nmagic!
0x06C1E9E4=I'll stand here and watch.
0x06C1EA0C=(Thanks...)
0x06C20AC4=Oh, by the way, if you need to heal...\ndo it yourself.
0x06C20B04=Ugh, at the speed you move, we'll be\nhere all month...
0x06C20B44=Do you want to finish this awful mission\nor don't you? Just get to it.
0x06C20BC4=Ooh ooh, here come some more.\nGo on, wipe 'em out!
0x06C20C4C=Go ahead.\nYou can use your Keyblade this time.
0x06C20C7C=Wait, what happened to learning magic?
0x06C20CFC=(Well, since you asked so nicely...)
0x06C22C54=Ugh, at the speed you move, we'll be\nhere all month...
0x06C22CCC=Ooh ooh, here come some more.\nGo on, wipe 'em out!
0x06C22D28=Go ahead.\nYou can use your Keyblade this time.
0x06C22D84=(Well, since you asked so nicely...)
0x06C23F04=Sheesh, about time.\nWorst. Mission. Ever...
0x06C23F78=What?\nYou have somebody else?
0x06C23F98=None of your beeswax.
0x06C24004=Maybe, one day, you'll be almost\nmediocre at it.
0x06C240B8=Unless, of course, we put somebody\nelse on Keyblade duty...
0x06C24178=If you're our big-shot Keyblade wielder,\nthen we're in deep doo-doo.
0x06C24224=Ugh, can't you even hold up your end of\na conversation?
0x06C242C4=Ugh, let's go―before you kill any more\nof my brain cells.
0x06C24300=You just worry about defeating\nHeartless and collecting hearts for us.
0x06C24348=You'd better pull it together, or we'll\nnever finish Kingdom Hearts.
0x06C2592C=Our work wouldn't go half as smoothly\nif we didn't gather the needed\nintelligence beforehand.
0x06C259C4=Now, listen carefully.\nYour mission today is to perform\nreconnaissance in this area.
0x06C25A1C=Oh, there's far more to the\nOrganization than that, boy.
0x06C25A78=First, take a look around the immediate\narea, and report anything unusual you\nfind.
0x06C25B90=Reconna-what?\nWhat about fighting Heartless and\ncollecting hearts?
0x06C25BDC=Fortunately, you are in good hands.\nI will be by your side today to help\nstimulate that insensate mind of yours.
0x06C25CBC=And don't go wandering too far until\nyou've carefully examined the clues\nclosest at hand.
0x06C27B70=Well, umm...let's see. The town has a\nlot of overpasses and underpasses.\nAnd the tram seems to circle the plaza.
0x06C27BE4=All right, then, what have you learned?
0x06C27C0C=Never mind.\nWouldn't want you to hurt yourself.
0x06C27C3C=We've been through the whole area.
0x06C27CE8=Huh?\nOh, umm... Err...
0x06C27DDC=You're done, boy.\nGo ahead and RTC.
0x06C27E08=You're showing some improvement, at\nleast, even if your natural talents do\nfall woefully short of my own.
0x06C27F4C=I could've figured it out if I had more\ntime.
0x06C28014=Anything else?
0x06C28024=But don't hold yourself up to my\nstandards. Little steps for little minds.
0x06C280A4=Oh, and there was that entrance that\nlooked like it led underground, but it\nwas shuttered.
0x06C28170=Oh? Is that so?\nThen take all the time you like.
0x06C301F4=Right!
0x06C30248=There's our target.
0x06C302F4=Here we go, Roxas!\nKeep your head out of the clouds!

0x06C38288=There's a sign in Station Heights―what else is on it\nbesides a sword and a shield?
0x06C382E0=a. The ground by the clothier
0x06C383A8=a. Three
0x06C383C0=b. Armor
0x06C383DC=c. A staff
0x06C383E8=c. Five
0x06C3A29C=All right, now that the mission is over,\ndo you have any questions?
0x06C3A34C=Kingdom Hearts will complete us.\nThat's the Organization's goal.
0x06C3A414=Well, that's not very nice.
0x06C3A430=Yeah, umm...
0x06C3A440=And when I defeat the Heartless, those\nhearts pop out and become part of\nKingdom Hearts, right?
0x06C3A4E8=But like, what's the point?
0x06C3A504=Each of us has a vital role in the\nOrganization.
0x06C3A580=Yeah, I get it.
0x06C3A628=No... Sorry.
0x06C3A638=Yours is collecting hearts.
0x06C3A654=Are you starting to see why you're so\nimportant?
0x06C3A6A4=I don't have a heart?
0x06C3A6BC=Any more questions?
0x06C3A6E0=Complete us?\nComplete us how?
0x06C3A73C=Just what is Kingdom Hearts?\nMarluxia said it was some kind of...of\nforce.
0x06C3A7B8=Correct. Like all of us, you entered the\nworld without one. But you can help us\nget them.
0x06C3A814=Kingdom Hearts is made of the very\nthings we lack―a multitude of hearts.\nIt has the power to complete us.
0x06C3AA58=Well, I just hope we can count on you to\n“get it” done.
0x06C3AAD4=Yes...?
0x06C3AAE8=Roxas, you and I and all the\nOrganization's members are what we\ncall Nobodies.
0x06C3AB38=Then we should be getting back.\nCome on.
0x06C3AB64=With a capital N. It's a name, for those\nof us who are missing a vital piece of\nwho we are: our hearts.
0x06C3B7AC=(Sorry...)
0x06C3B87C=Start over.\nAnd this time, do it right!
0x06C3B8A4=Ugh, what are you doing?\nYou're so...BAD at this!
0x06C442E4=Houses have been built along the\nterrace.
0x06C4443C=And at the top is a station.\nThe trains there are the town's\nprimary system of transit.
0x06C444A4=That's the next step: analyzing the\ndata you find.
0x06C44558=And stay on the path, if you please!
0x06C44580=But that's just it! I only stated what I\nsaw. There was no “figuring” involved.
0x06C4460C=Up there, see that clock tower?\nThat's the station building.
0x06C4464C=Based on its location, we know the\ntracks are probably elevated.
0x06C446E4=You figured all that out just now?
0x06C44720=Everything you need to know about this\nplaza lies along it―provided you are\ncapable of connecting the dots.
0x06C44790=Follow this path and investigate the\nremainder of the area.
0x06C447CC=Here's what I see:\nThis whole town was built along a\nmountain.
0x06C4487C=This whole town is a blueprint of their\nlives.
0x06C448AC=Well, you're not off the hook yet, boy.\nIf I let you quit with these results, I'll\nbe the laughingstock of the castle.
0x06C44A9C=And this must be downtown.\nAll these shops in one place...
0x06C44AEC=Roxas, you are looking but not seeing.
0x06C44B28=That's why the roads slope.
0x06C44BB8=The clothing and jewelry shops tell us\nhow these people live.
0x06C44C00=Distressing. Very distressing.\nYour mind wasn't made for this, was it?
0x06C44C48=Now, what about this path you pointed\nout?
0x06C45E38=Your goal should be to gather the\nmaximum amount of data in the minimum\namount of time.
0x06C45E90=But while I applaud your effort, you\nneed to be able to see these things at\nfirst glance.
0x06C45F44=Spend too much time dallying, and you\nrisk being seen.
0x06C45FC4=I understand.
0x06C45FE8=Hmm, not bad. You're finally starting to\nsee the bigger picture.
0x06C461C4=Oh...right.
0x06C461D0=Today's mission was just an exercise.\nI am satisfied. Let's return.
0x06C46240=Sometimes the locals will be wary.\nYou need to be warier.
0x06C476C4=Yes, boy. You didn't think you'd be\nmulling about here forever, did you?
0x06C47764=any number of variables that could be\nturned to our advantage in the missions\nahead.
0x06C477DC=That concludes today's mission.\nAny questions or concerns?
0x06C47818=Umm...\nHow often do I have to do this?
0x06C478B0=That's right.\nNow come along.
0x06C478D0=You will visit many worlds for many\nreasons...but our ultimate goal remains\nthe same.
0x06C47A98=Kingdom Hearts.
0x06C47B6C=Every world is unique, with its own\nterrain, values, Heartless population―
0x06C47BBC=Wait, “every world”?\nYou mean there's more than one?
0x06C47BF8=Whenever the Organization needs to\nknow more about a world, naturally.
0x06C48884=Okay...\nYeah, sure.
0x06C48898=So how 'bout that ice cream?
